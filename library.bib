The ideal means to communicate a civic political programme to the entering prince and burghers, they shared the persuasive rhetoric of contemporary theatre and painting. By the beginning of the seventeenth century, these theatrical features were no longer able to compete with theatre and painting. The success and decline of the tableaux are discussed, focusing on the Ghent entry of Philip the Good in 1458, the Antwerp entry of Charles V and his son Philip in 1549, and the Antwerp entry of don Ferdinand in 1635. These are linked with theatre, from the rederijkers (rhetoricians) to Jesuit spectacle, and with paintings by the brothers Van Eijck, Van der Goes, Coecke van Aelst and Rubens.},

Kress Foundation, in conjunction with the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, sponsored a survey of the art history community to clarify the field's perceptions about digital art history and its impact on the discipline. The findings reveal uncertainty among community members about the value and role of digital art history and a reticence to embrace it as an emerging aspect of the discipline. The reasons for the uncertainty are embedded in the culture and tradition of art historical research, in infrastructure limitations, in digitization and access challenges, and in concerns about online publishing. Guiding the discipline toward greater acceptance of digital scholarship will require incisive action, starting with greater dialogue across the community about what art history should be in the twenty-first century, and the role that digital art history will play in that scenario.},

  abstract = {"The seventeenth century in the Northern Netherlands was a period that saw the widespread 'domestication' of easel pictures, when paintings were acquired in significant numbers by a broad cross-section of society as a means of decorating the home. This is the first extended study to look at the role and function of paintings and other works of art in Dutch homes of the seventeenth century. In what numbers were paintings dispersed throughout the various rooms of the house? Were certain subjects regarded as more appropriate than others for display in a particular room? In what arrangements were paintings hung on the walls and how did this affect the way in which they were apprehended? A wide range of contemporary sources are drawn upon, including estate inventories and other archival material, published texts on art, architecture and social manners, and images of the domestic interior. In one chapter a close analysis is made of a small number of individual inventories, which are fully transcribed in the appendices, investigating the motivations that lie behind the display of works of art and their relationship to other furnishings."--BOOK JACKET.},

Known by the acronym ANT, the method privileges objects as critical agents in creating, sustaining, and extending social ties and thus offers a model for capturing the dynamics underlying the interdependencies between Rembrandt, his art, his patrons, and collectors. I focus on Rembrandt's works presented and circulated as gifts, which epitomize the short-lived assemblies between humans and objects that ANT considers the cornerstone of social activity. Drawing on ANT's approach, I highlight the agency of these works in materializing and enhancing the reciprocal ties that bound networks of collectors and liefhebbers together with Rembrandt.},

Algorithmic methods now make it possible for this knowledge to be expressed to a computer. Compared to the alternative of describing style in natural language, the computer methods offer the advantage that they can be tested for validity. The tests are accomplished by using the computer to generate new compositions in the style described. The authors demonstrate these methods with algorithmic descriptions of the styles of Richard Diebenkorn and Joan Mir{\'o} and the generation of new compositions in their styles. A shape grammar algorithm for Diebenkorn is presented which accounts for the linear facture of his "Ocean Park" series. The problem of shape in Mir{\'o}'s work is tackled, and progress is reported on synthesizing composition in the style of his "Constellation" series. Further uses of algorithmic description of painting styles include mechanical storage, search and retrieval in art archives, attribution studies and diachronic studies of stylistic change.},

Intended primarily for the museums, libraries, academic departments, and visual resources centers that support research in art history within the U.S., this project focused on five key areas:
 
1. The emergence of "digital art history," and how it is diverging from the broader understanding of the digital humanities. 

2. The interconnected scholarly communities that support art history, including museums, libraries, and visual resources centers, both within and beyond an art historian's home institution.

3. The changes that digitization and online search portals have brought to the process of searching for primary sources and the limitations of the current discovery environment.

4. The practices art historians employ for managing their large personal collections of digital images. 

5. The state of graduate students' professional training.

 
Within these five areas, the report makes clear that the needs of art historians can be successfully met only through the collaborative work of many support organizations. Our findings suggest several opportunities for these organizations to develop new funding, services, tools, and initiatives that will have far-reaching impact on the discipline.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics such as language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics such as age. As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

  abstract = {The emergent processes driving cultural history are a product of complex interactions among large numbers of individuals, determined by difficult-to-quantify historical conditions. To characterize these processes, we have reconstructed aggregate intellectual mobility over two millennia through the birth and death locations of more than 150,000 notable individuals. The tools of network and complexity theory were then used to identify characteristic statistical patterns and determine the cultural and historical relevance of deviations. The resulting network of locations provides a macroscopic perspective of cultural history, which helps us to retrace cultural narratives of Europe and North America using large-scale visualization and quantitative dynamical tools and to derive historical trends of cultural centers beyond the scope of specific events or narrow time intervals.
A macroscopic view of cultural history
Sociologists and anthropologists study the growth and evolution of human culture, but it is hard to measure cultural interactions on a historical time scale. Schich et al. developed a tool for extracting information about cultural history from simple but large sets of birth and death records. A network of cultural centers connected via the birth and death of more than 150,000 notable individuals revealed human mobility patterns and cultural attraction dynamics. Patterns of city growth over a period of 2000 years differed between countries, but the distribution of birth-to-death distances remained unchanged over more than eight centuries.

New theories in several fields are challenging some of the most pervasive of these assumptions, by conceptualizing change as a punctuated equilibrium: an alternation between long periods when stable infrastructures permit only incremental adaptations, and brief periods of revolutionary upheaval. This article compares models from six domains-adult, group, and organizational development, history of science, biological evolution, and physical science-to explicate the punctuated equilibrium paradigm and show its broad applicability for organizational studies. Models are juxtaposed to generate new research questions about revolutionary change in organizational settings: how it is triggered, how systems function during such periods, and how it concludes.

  abstract = {This book explores the ways in which Flemish painting between 1550 and 1650 both represented and reflected the burgeoning capitalism of Antwerp, the major port of Europe at that time. Elizabeth Honig focuses not only on market-scene paintings but also on the interaction between painters and markets as it was influenced by the changing roles played by merchants, church and city governments, and consumers. Honig discusses the paintings of Pieter Aertsen and his nephew Joachim Beuckelaer within the context of a developing aesthetic of exchange, as art became increasingly defined as an alluring commodity that aroused in its beholder a desire for possession and called upon the tempering forces of individual reason and self-judgment. She then examines the relation between painting and the market that emerged in Antwerp after the Spanish reconquest, a period of social, economic, and religious retrenchment. Analyzing works by Frans Snyders, Jan Bruegel, and others, she shows how the dynamism of market commerce was pictorially masked to provide an illusion of stasis: still-life painting became the inheritor of - and subverter of - the market scene. Finally she considers the implications of an aesthetic of display within a newly dominant manner of artistic production (collaboration) and consumption (connoisseurship), as painters tried to produce works that would appeal to the tastes of consumers.},

It concludes that only a strategy for historical explanation that synthesizes social structural and cultural analysis can adequately explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of networks themselves.

Different periods of Mondrian's life correspond to distinct types of nonfigurative compositions, but can the distinction be formalized? How many bits or numbers are needed to characterize a typical composition? Can the rules of a composition type be expressed in the language of the computer? If distinct composition types require different computer programs, can these be based on a common framework, a mechanism, perhaps? The findings presented here are only tentative, but it is interesting to note that some characteristics can be modeled reasonably well, whereas others still resist formalization in the presented framework. The author's approach borrows principles from genetic programming. Employing a built-in random number generator, it can be used to explore a large space of "compositions."},

"Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge in Early Modern Europe" features fascinating reproductions of woodcuts, engravings, and etchings; maps, globe gores, and globes; multilayered anatomical 'flap' prints; and, paper scientific instruments used for observation and measurement.

  volume = {90},
  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.90.042806},
  abstract = {Most of the complex social, technological, and biological networks have a significant community structure. Therefore the community structure of complex networks has to be considered as a universal property, together with the much explored small-world and scale-free properties of these networks. Despite the large interest in characterizing the community structures of real networks, not enough attention has been devoted to the detection of universal mechanisms able to spontaneously generate networks with communities. Triadic closure is a natural mechanism to make new connections, especially in social networks. Here we show that models of network growth based on simple triadic closure naturally lead to the emergence of community structure, together with fat-tailed distributions of node degree and high clustering coefficients. Communities emerge from the initial stochastic heterogeneity in the concentration of links, followed by a cycle of growth and fragmentation. Communities are the more pronounced, the sparser the graph, and disappear for high values of link density and randomness in the attachment procedure. By introducing a fitness-based link attractivity for the nodes, we find a phase transition where communities disappear for high heterogeneity of the fitness distribution, but a different mesoscopic organization of the nodes emerges, with groups of nodes being shared between just a few superhubs, which attract most of the links of the system.},

In addition, data were collected on the informal roles played by crewmembers (e.g., instrumental leadership, expressive leadership). The study found that globally coherent networks in winter-over groups were associated with group consensus on the presence of critically important informal social roles (e.g., expressive leadership) where global coherence is the extent to which a network forms a smile group composed of a unitary core and periphery as opposed to being factionalized into two or more subgroups. Conversely, the evolution of multiple subgroups was associated with the absence of consensus on critical informal social roles, above all the critically important role of instrumental leader.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, social network analysis (SNA) has become a major analytical paradigm in sociology and now occupies a strategic place in disciplinary debates on a wide variety of issues. Historians, however, have been slow to adopt the approach for at least three reasons. First, the conceptual orientation of sociologists practicing historical social network analysis (HSNA) remains unfamiliar to the majority of professional historians. Just when SNA was maturing in the late 1980s and 1990s, the interdisciplinary interest in social science theory among historians, so characteristic of the 1970s and early 1980s, began to wane. The subsequent turn toward post modernist thinking in history left the profession increasingly uninformed about both classical and contemporary social theory. Second, those quantitatively-oriented historians who might be predisposed to use SNA's specialized statistical methods constitute less than a quarter of the profession today, thus the risk of SNA finding its way into mainstream historical scholarship is low to start. Third, SNA's data requirements are formidable. SNA demands evidence of social interaction among all members of a social system for a variety of behaviors, and thus necessitates a broad range of high-quality records for the place, time and activities being studied. Because historians are plagued by an incomplete historical record and imperfect understandings of past social relations, HSNA remains an inherently problematic enterprise. Yet despite conceptual, methodological and evidentiary obstacles, SNA possesses real potential for historical analysis.},

Then it demonstrates precisely how these interactions and relationships form.  This is a book for the social network novice learning how to study, think about and analyse social networks; the intermediate user, not yet familiar with some of the newer developments in the field; and the teacher looking for a range of exercises, as well as an up-to-date historical account of the field.   It is divided into three clear sections:  1. Historical \& Background Concepts 2. Levels of Analysis 3. Advances, Extensions and Conclusions  The book provides a full overview of the field - historical origins, common theoretical perspectives and frameworks; traditional and current analytical procedures and fundamental mathematical equations needed to get a foothold in the field.},

These failures, an inevitable feature of modelling, point to the key question for humanities computing, how we know what we know, and so to the beginning of its own scholarly enquiry. This, I argue, proceeds along three branches, the algorithmic, the metatextual, and the representational. Examining the first of these here I argue for research toward an open-ended, interoperable set of primitives based on previous work in the field and designed for the emerging digital library environment. To set the stage for their further development I argue that the field as a whole does not wait on a theoretical formulation of what humanists do, rather should look to the tradition of experimental knowledge-making as this has been illuminated in recent years by historians, philosophers, and sociologists of science.},

  title = {Mapping the ``{{White}}, {{Marmorean Flock}}'': {{Anne Whitney Abroad}}, 1867\textendash{}1868},
  volume = {13},
  abstract = {The poet and sculptor Anne Whitney (1821\textendash{}1915) was an important member of Boston's intersecting literary, artistic, and political circles throughout her long life. She and her companion, the painter Addy Manning, lived abroad from 1867 to 1871 and from 1875 to 1876, primarily in Rome but also in Florence and Paris, with several months each summer spent elsewhere in Europe. Whitney wrote biweekly letters to her family, and they responded in kind; almost 400 letters survive from her time abroad, providing vivid evidence about her movement through time and space and her experience of foreign cultures.

Whitney is usually associated with the group of female artists in Rome that Henry James so evocatively\textemdash{}and dismissively\textemdash{}described as a ``white, marmorean flock.'' Her letters document her relationships with her sister artists over the years and across the European continent. In fact, Whitney's letters make her the best documented of these artists, though she is perhaps the least known today. Although contemporaries seemed to understand the women best as indistinguishable members of an artificially constructed group, a careful reading of Whitney's letters demonstrates how different these women were, not only in the art they produced but also in their backgrounds, ages, and preferred style, materials, and iconography. The letters also show that the desire to travel abroad was not dictated solely by the need to study the celebrated art and architecture of the past. Rather, it was the entire cultural experience, and how that experience transformed an artist's life in diverse and unexpected ways, that had the greatest and most lingering impact.

The number, length, and complexity of Whitney's letters and the diverse stories they tell lend themselves to the tools of digital humanities; the depth and breadth of the information they contain could not be utilized to its full potential within the confines of a more traditional article. Instead, this publication features interactive maps and timelines created with a customized version of the Omeka plug-in Neatline to illustrate the first sixteen months of Whitney's life abroad, with extensive quotations from her letters to provide a sense of her voice and thoughts on a wide variety of topics. My examination begins with her departure from the United States in March 1867 and continues through her arrival in Rome, her summer across the Alps, and her fall, winter, and spring in Rome, ending in July 1868, as she prepared to leave the city for another summer of travel. By visualizing this data in combination with additional information from other archives, primary source materials, and contemporary photographs, and setting it against historical maps, Whitney's experiences become a richly detailed case study of an American female artist abroad during this important era.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to enrich the standard toolbox for measuring diversity in economics. In so doing, we compare the indicators of diversity used by economists with those used by biologists and ecologists.   Ecologists and biologists are concerned about biodiversity: The diversity of organisms that inhabit a given area. Concepts of species diversity such as alpha (diversity within community), beta (diversity across communities) and gamma (diversity due to differences among samples when they are combined into a single sample) have been developed (Whittaker, 1960). Biodiversity is more complex than just the species that are present, it includes species richness and species evenness. Those various aspects of diversity are measured by biodiversity indices such as Simpson's Diversity Indices, Species Richness Index, Shannon Weaver Diversity Indices, Patil and Taillie Index, Modified Hill's Ratio.   In economics, diversity measures are multi-faceted ranging from  inequality (Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, quintile distribution), to polarisation (Esteban and Ray, 1994; Wolfon, 1994, D'Ambrosio (2001)) and heterogeneity (Alesina, Baqir and Hoxby, 2000).  We propose an interdisciplinary comparison between indicators. In particular, we review their theoretical background and applications. We provide an assessment of their possible use and interest according to their specific properties.},

Cultural heritage professionals are also beginning to use visualizations and computational tools to expand the availability and explorability of their collections. This article locates the current field of information visualization within its historical context, demonstrating the shift in aesthetic practice within the field from the mid-eighteenth century to the present day. A number of current projects are presented to illustrate how information visualization is mediating formal humanities research and the study and management of collections.},

  abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

The case study is then deployed of the iconography of the Assomption. The transformation of information is then compared, in a systematic way with that of person transportation. Love talk, the only remnant of theology without belief in subtance, is then reformatted.},

  abstract = {Measurement of diversity is important in several sciences but has evolved mainly within ecology. An ecological community with many species is more diverse than one with few but the way the total number of individuals is distributed among the species also influences the degree of diversity or heterogeneity. Although not always explicitly used, it can be shown that diversity is a concept of some importance in psychology, too. In general terms quantification of diversity is related to the apportionment of some quantity into a number of well-defined classes. The dual-concept type of diversity index reflects both the number of classes and the degree of evenness (homogeneity) of the apportionment. The quantity that is distributed has commonly been a population of elements and apportionment homogeneity measures population heterogeneity. The statistical context has dominated the thinking about the measurement of diversity, heterogeneity, and homogeneity. Some well-known indices of diversity and the ideas behind them are discussed. It is concluded that the general geometric representation of homogeneity (similarity) and heterogeneity (dissimilarity) (Junge, 1978; 1991) offers a more general approach to the measurement of diversity.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the measurement of diversity of a biological or ecological sample of individuals belonging to various species. Using the concept of statistical odds, an alternative diversity measure with an appealing interpretation is formulated as a simple modification of the popular Simpson index. If $\Sigma$ p\textsubscript{i}\textsuperscript{2} denotes the sum of the squared proportions of individuals belonging to the different species in the sample, the new odds measure of diversity is simply defined by OD=($\Sigma$ p\textsubscript{i}\textsuperscript{2})\textsuperscript{-1}-1 and has the following interpretation: OD is the odds that two individuals selected at random (with replacement) from the sample are of different species. The same modification is also applied to a couple of other measures in use, providing them with convenient odds interpretations. These measures are all members of the same parameterized family, which represents a slight modification of the Hill's family. The inverse of OD is proposed as an odds measure of species homogeneity. Also, some properties of the different measures are outlined, and the measurement of evenness is discussed. Finally, some new indices of individual species dominance and surprise are briefly mentioned.},

The rarefaction technique overestimates the number of species that would be expected by sampling. The magnitude of the overestimation is strongly influenced by the distribution of individuals among species in the original sample and by the presence of even moderate spatial aggregation. Four diversity indices, one of them newly proposed here, are compared in terms of their response to changes in the numbers of individuals and species, in the distribution of the individuals among the species, and in spatial aggregation. To increase comparability, it is suggested that scaled values be used; the scaling should be done in terms of the possible range of values of the index for the given numbers of individuals and species. Two indices can be related to probabilities of intra- versus interspecific encounters, and are only indirect measures of the evenness of distribution of individuals among species. The other two are direct measures of evenness. Which index is selected should be determined on the basis of what property is to be used as a measure of diversity.},

  title = {Toward {{Automated Discovery}} of {{Artistic Influence}}},
  abstract = {Considering the huge amount of art pieces that exist, there is valuable information to be discovered. Examining a painting, an expert can determine its style, genre, and the time period that the painting belongs. One important task for art historians is to find influences and connections between artists. Is influence a task that a computer can measure? The contribution of this paper is in exploring the problem of computer-automated suggestion of influences between artists, a problem that was not addressed before in a general setting. We first present a comparative study of different classification methodologies for the task of fine-art style classification. A two-level comparative study is performed for this classification problem. The first level reviews the performance of discriminative vs. generative models, while the second level touches the features aspect of the paintings and compares semantic-level features vs. low-level and intermediate-level features present in the painting. Then, we investigate the question "Who influenced this artist?" by looking at his masterpieces and comparing them to others. We pose this interesting question as a knowledge discovery problem. For this purpose, we investigated several painting-similarity and artist-similarity measures. As a result, we provide a visualization of artists (Map of Artists) based on the similarity between their works},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jas.2014.05.027},
  abstract = {Archaeological network analysts often represent archaeological data as static networks and explore their structure. However, most networks changed through time and static network representations do not allow archaeologists to test assumptions about the dynamic processes driving this change. The study of visibility networks in archaeology is a good example of this. Archaeologists propose hypotheses of the role of lines of sight between settlements, which imply dynamic processes for the establishment of the observed visibility networks. However, commonly used methods do not allow us to evaluate these hypotheses. In this paper we introduce exponential random graph modelling (ERGM) as a method for bridging static and dynamic approaches to interpreting visibility networks. This method offers a number of advantages: (1) it explicitly addresses the assumptions inherent in visibility network creation about what relationships between nodes mean and the types of processes they allow for; (2) it allows one to investigate the range of network structures that these assumptions give rise to; and (3) it explores the dynamic processes that might have led to observed networks. This method is used to evaluate hypotheses of the role of lines of sight in facilitating visual control and communication during the later Iron Age in Southern Spain. This study shows that ERGMs can be used as a reflective technique to evaluate competing hypotheses, and that ERGM results subsequently require more contextualised evaluation. Future work on ERGMs should focus on incorporating geographical constraints to further enhance its potential for studying visibility networks.},

  abstract = {The past five years have witnessed a growing interest amongst art historians in the potential of digital projects to impact, if not transform, the discipline. A steep rise in conferences and institutes dedicated to digital art history, along with funding opportunities and institutional support, has accelerated the rate at which art historians are now engaging with digital techniques. With this new visibility, art historians have criticized themselves for lagging behind other disciplines such as history and archaeology. This article questions the assumption that art historians have been slow to embrace digital tools and methods through a brief historical examination of projects undertaken by institutions and scholars during the infancy of art history computing: the early 1980s through the early 1990s. Using Johanna Drucker's distinction of the "digitized" and "digital" iterations of art history, this essay traces the genealogies of both categories, arguing that scholars have been more active in theorizing, practicing and creating digital methods than is often seen to be the case. Ultimately, this essay is an attempt to help define from a historical perspective what "digital art history" is and how it has been practiced.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a few reflections on the origins, historiography and condition of the field often referred to as Digital Art History (DAH), with references, among others, to the activities of the Computers and the History of Art group (CHArt, est. 1985) and my personal experience, spanning over 20 years, first as a postgraduate student, then doctoral researcher and eventually Lecturer in DAH. The publications and teaching activities of scholars connected to CHArt are seen as indicative of the evolution of the field internationally. Personal experience, or a reality check, is limited to higher education in the UK. The key argument here concerns the question$\-\-$able benefit of promoting DAH as a discrete discipline and detaching digital practices from the mainstream history of art and its institutions. When introduced in the late 1990s, the `DAH' served to indicate a dramatic shift in the way art history could be practiced, taught, studied and communicated. The changes were brought about by widening access to computers and information technology. DAH was suggested\textemdash``perhaps a little ahead of time\textemdash{}as a new kind of intellectual fusion'' (W. Vaughan). It is no longer necessary to argue for the wise use of computers. Digital technology has become part and parcel of teaching, learning and re$\-$search. It is the History of Art and its more traditional research methods and critical per$\-$spectives that are seen at risk of neglect. The theories of crisis, even `death' of Art History have contributed to general anxiety over the discipline's future. However, a discipline has ``the ability and power to control and judge its borders'' (R. Nelson). The discipline of Art History is richer and stronger through the fusion of digital scholarship with, not separation, from more traditional methodologies and critical canons. The need to continue with the `digital' distinction is questionable.},

  volume = {56},
  issn = {1474-0583},
  doi = {10.1017/S0003975615000107},
  abstract = {The ``performativity thesis'' is the claim that parts of contemporary economics and finance, when carried out into the world by professionals and popularizers, reformat and reorganize the phenomena they purport to describe, in ways that bring the world into line with theory. Practical technologies, calculative devices and portable algorithms give actors tools to implement particular models of action. I argue that social network analysis is performative in the same sense as the cases studied in this literature. Social network analysis and finance theory are similar in key aspects of their development and effects. For the case of economics, evidence for weaker versions of the performativity thesis is quite good, and the strong formulation is circumstantially supported. Network theory easily meets the evidential threshold for the weaker versions. I offer empirical examples that support the strong (or ``Barnesian'') formulation. Whether these parallels are a mark in favor of the thesis or a strike against it is an open question. I argue that the social network technologies and models now being ``performed'' build out systems of generalized reciprocity, connectivity, and commons-based production. This is in contrast both to an earlier network imagery that emphasized self-interest and entrepreneurial exploitation of structural opportunities, and to the model of action typically considered to be performed by economic technologies. R{\'e}sum{\'e} La \guillemotleft{} th{\`e}se de la performativit{\'e} \guillemotright{} est l'affirmation selon laquelle des {\'e}l{\'e}ments de la finance et de l'{\'e}conomie contemporaines, une fois import{\'e}s dans le monde par des professionnels ou des vulgarisateurs, contribuent {\`a} reformater et {\`a} r{\'e}organiser le ph{\'e}nom{\`e}ne qu'ils cherchent {\`a} d{\'e}crire, de telle mani{\`e}re que le monde se conforme {\`a} la th{\'e}orie. Technologies pratiques, dispositifs calculatoires et algorithmes mobiles donnent aux acteurs des outils pour mettre en {\oe}uvre des mod{\`e}les d'action particuliers. Il est montr{\'e} ici que l'analyse des r{\'e}seaux sociaux est performative au sens d{\'e}fini dans cette litt{\'e}rature. L'analyse des r{\'e}seaux sociaux et la th{\'e}orie de la finance sont similaires dans des aspects cl{\'e}s de leur d{\'e}veloppement et de leur effets. Pour le cas de l'{\'e}conomie, les preuves pour les versions faibles de la th{\`e}se de la performativit{\'e} sont bonnes, et certains {\'e}l{\'e}ments circonstantiels viennent {\`a} l'appui de versions fortes. La th{\'e}orie des r{\'e}seaux satisfait non seulement sans difficult{\'e} aux crit{\`e}res des versions faibles, mais cet article propose diff{\'e}rents exemples empiriques {\`a} l'appui d'une version forte, de type Barnesienne. Savoir si ces parall{\`e}les renforcent ou affaiblissent la th{\`e}se de la performativit{\'e} demeure une question ouverte. Je soutiens que les technologies et les mod{\`e}les de r{\'e}seaux sociaux, consid{\'e}r{\'e}s comme des entit{\'e}s performatives, construisent des syst{\`e}mes de r{\'e}ciprocit{\'e} g{\'e}n{\'e}ralis{\'e}e, de connectivit{\'e} et de production partag{\'e}. Cela s'oppose {\`a} la fois {\`a} l'image d'un r{\'e}seau d{\'e}fini en termes d'int{\'e}r{\^e}t individuel et d'exploitation entrepreneuriale des structures d'opportunit{\'e}s, mais {\'e}galement {\`a} un mod{\`e}le d'action \guillemotleft{} perform{\'e} \guillemotright{} par les techniques {\'e}conomiques. Zusammenfassung Die Performativit{\"a}tstheorie stellt die Behauptung auf, dass Elemente der heutigen Finanz- und Wirtschaftswelt, einmal von Profis und ,,Vulgarisatoren`` {\"u}bernommen, dazu beitragen, das von ihnen beschriebene Ph{\"a}nomen neu zu formatieren und zu organisieren, und zwar derart, dass die Welt sich der Theorie anpasst. Praktische Technologien, Rechenger{\"a}te und mobile Algorhythmen geben den Handelnden Mittel, um spezifische Handlungsmodelle umzusetzen. Ich zeige hier, dass die Analyse der sozialen Netzwerke im Sinne dieser Literatur performativ ist. Die Analyse der sozialen Netzwerke und der Finanztheorie sind in wichtigen Bereichen ihrer Entwicklung und Auswirkungen vergleichbar. Im Falle der Wirtschaft gibt es gute Beweise f{\"u}r die schwache Version der Performativit{\"a}tstheorie, und gewisse Umst{\"a}nde best{\"a}tigen die starken Versionen. Die Netzwerktheorie erf{\"u}llt nicht nur problemlos die Kriterien der schw{\"a}cheren Versionen, sondern ich schlage gleichfalls verschiedene empirische Beispiele vor, die die starke Version, so die von Barnes, bekr{\"a}ftigen. Die Frage, ob diese Parallelen die Performativit{\"a}tstheorie verst{\"a}rken oder schw{\"a}chen, bleibt jedoch offen. Ich behaupte, dass die als performativen Einheiten betrachteten Technologien und sozialen Netzwerkmodelle Systeme verallgemeinernder Gegenseitigkeit, Vernetzung und Produktionsteilung schaffen. Dies widerspricht sowohl der Vorstellung eines begrenzten Netzes bez{\"u}glich der individuellen Interessen und der gesch{\"a}ftlichen Nutzung von Gelegenheitsstrukturen, als auch einem ,,performierten`` Aktionsmodell durch wirtschaftliche Techniken.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

  abstract = {Long House Valley in the Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona (U.S.) was inhabited by the Kayenta Anasazi from about 1800 before Christ to about anno Domini 1300. These people were prehistoric ancestors of the modern Pueblo cultures of the Colorado Plateau. Paleoenvironmental research based on alluvial geomorphology, palynology, and dendroclimatology permits accurate quantitative reconstruction of annual fluctuations in potential agricultural production (kg of maize per hectare). The archaeological record of Anasazi farming groups from anno Domini 200-1300 provides information on a millennium of sociocultural stasis, variability, change, and adaptation. We report on a multiagent computational model of this society that closely reproduces the main features of its actual history, including population ebb and flow, changing spatial settlement patterns, and eventual rapid decline. The agents in the model are monoagriculturalists, who decide both where to situate their fields as well as the location of their settlements. Nutritional needs constrain fertility. Agent heterogeneity, difficult to model mathematically, is demonstrated to be crucial to the high fidelity of the model.},

  abstract = {The discourse about the `death of French literature' which has spread throughout the Anglo-American publishing industry since the 1990s raises the question of the conditions required for a dominant national literature to maintain its symbolic capital in the era of globalization. This discourse is a sell-fulfilling prophecy used as a weapon in the international competition and struggles within the world market of translation in a context of accrued economic constraints. The present article first confronts discourse to practice through ohHan empirical study of the circulation of French literature in the United States in the era of globalization, based on a quantitative analysis of all the literary titles translated from French in the United States between 1990 and 2003, on interviews with publishers and translators, and on archives. The symbolic capital of French literature appears to be founded not only on its past achievements (classics) but also on its present production, which accounts for 40\% of the translations. Although most are novels, upmarket genres like poetry and theatre are better represented than commercial genres. The data also displays the growing diversity of translated authors, regarding gender and nationality. However, the high centralization of the publishing field in the Francophone area impacts the circulation pattern: most translated works were published in Paris. The article then turns to analyse the structure of the American publishing field, using Bourdieu's opposition between small-scale and large-scale production: French literature is located at the pole of small-scale production, a factor that explains its growing invisibility. A network analysis displays three clusters of publishers: large conglomerates who prefer to reprint classics, university presses engaged in the canonization of modern French literature, and small independent publishers investing in living writers. A by-product of the stiffening of commercial constraints on the publishing industry, the discourse on the `death of French literature' paradoxically contributes to nourishing the well-founded fiction of national literatures. On the theoretical level, using world system analysis, field theory and the concept of symbolic capital helps explain isomorphism by imitation in the global market of translation.},

  abstract = {A series of case studies relevant to Florentine art patronage and its broader Italian context. Draws on largely unpublished documents in the archives of the Medici family from the 17th c. Focuses particularly on the collecting interests of Cardinal Leopoldo de Medici and the efforts of his nephew Cosimo III to organize artistic affairs at court during the first years of his reign. Shows that the artistic patronage of the Granducal house was inseparable from the network of personal and political patronage that was the traditional basis of state machinery. Considers relations of the Medici to the following: the Ranuzzi Cospi, the Sirani, the Falconieri, Paolo del Sera, Otlavio Falconieri, Paolo Falconieri, Louis Mons{\`u} Vouet, Ciro Ferri, Vicente Victoria, Ercole Ferrata, Innocent XI, and the Accademia del Gran Duca della Toscana.

The study investigates the network structure of a Mafia organization, describing its evolution and highlighting its plasticity to interventions targeting membership and its resilience to disruption caused by police operations. We analyze two different datasets about Mafia gangs built by examining different digital trails and judicial documents spanning a period of ten years: the former dataset includes the phone contacts among suspected individuals, the latter is constituted by the relationships among individuals actively involved in various criminal offenses. Our report illustrates the limits of traditional investigation methods like tapping: criminals high up in the organization hierarchy do not occupy the most central positions in the criminal network, and oftentimes do not appear in the reconstructed criminal network at all. However, we also suggest possible strategies of intervention, as we show that although criminal networks (i.e., the network encoding mobsters and crime relationships) are extremely resilient to different kind of attacks, contact networks (i.e., the network reporting suspects and reciprocated phone calls) are much more vulnerable and their analysis can yield extremely valuable insights.},

  abstract = {Literary historians have long been interested in sociological approaches to literature. The field of modernism, a major aesthetic movement that flourished between 1915-40 primarily in the United States, England, and Europe, but the rest of the world as well, has been seen as a particularly compelling site to explore the sociological underpinnings of art. It is in this movement that many of our ideas of the ``autonomy of art'' and the ``genius'' of the artist emerged, and scholars such as Lawrence Rainey have produced excellent, archive-driven accounts of the institutions, patronage systems, and personal networks that conditioned and produced this field of production.
In this essay, we exploit new methods of aggregating vast amounts of bibliographic data and new network visualization tools to ``scale up'' this sociological approach to modernism. While scholars such as Rainey have been limited by the contours of specific institutional or writer archives, and the self-reported accounts of the field by the writers themselves, our approach transforms large empirical bibliographic data, regarding which poets published where and when, into network visualizations that provide a panoptic view of the modernist field as a whole. We then use these visualizations to develop a body of new conceptual categories, such as ``brokerage'' and ``closure,'' to analyze the structural relations between poets and how their interactions help to constitute the field of modernist poetry as a whole.},

We review techniques employed in a variety of applications, including art history, bibliography, genealogy, commerce, and government, providing a framework of personal name characteristics, factors in selecting matching techniques, and types of applications. Personal names, as data elements in information systems, vary for a wide range of legitimate reasons, including cultural and historical traditions, translation and transliteration, reporting and recording variations, as well as typographical and phonetic errors. Some matching applications seek to link variants, while others seek to correct errors. The choice of matching techniques will vary in the amount of domain knowledge about the names that is incorporated, the sources of data, and the human and computing resources required. Personal name-matching techniques may be included in name authority work, information retrieval, or duplicate detection, with some applications matching on name only, and others combining personal names with other data elements in record linkage techniques. We discuss both phonetic- and pattern-matching techniques, reviewing a range of implemented and proposed name-matching techniques in the context of these factors. \textcopyright{} 1992 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Rembrandt's production was far from stable. He had periods of high productivity alternating with periods in which he completed only few paintings. We related trends in Rembrandt's productivity to that of three of his main competitors in Amsterdam: Jacob Backer, Ferdinand Bol en Govert Flinck. Because sheer numbers of paintings are of limited value to fully grasp the production of the painters in the context of the highly competitive Amsterdam art market, we also took size and subject matter into consideration. We have observed significant changes in individual productivity during the careers of these four painters. They worked in the same period under the same market conditions, yet their careers differ in many respects. Backer and Bol seem to have had relatively stable levels of production throughout their careers. Their apparently loyal patrons and clients kept faithful to their 'brand'. Backer died at an early age, but Bol became wealthy. Govert Flinck too became wealthy, yet he made a radical decision in the 1650's to concentrate on history paintings. This decision was artistically ambitious yet financially risky. In Flinck's case it turned out well. Rembrandt's career of alternating periods of high and unusually low productivity differs greatly from the other three careers. The inconsistency could be partly due to a lack of personal discipline. Without pressure by employers and creditors he struggled to produce. Another possible explanation might be that the demand for "Rembrandtesque" works may have dwindled in and after the 1640's. Etchings and tuition fees could not sufficiently compensate the loss of income, culminating in Rembrandt's bankruptcy.},

  abstract = {The recent interest in Big Data has generated a broad range of new academic, corporate, and policy practices along with an evolving debate amongst its proponents, detractors, and skeptics. While the practices draw on a common set of tools, techniques, and technologies, most contributions to the debate come either from a particular disciplinary perspective or with an eye on a domain-specific issue. A close examination of these contributions reveals a set of common problematics that arise in various guises in different places. It also demonstrates the need for a critical synthesis of the conceptual and practical dilemmas surrounding Big Data. The purpose of this article is to provide such a synthesis by drawing on relevant writings in the sciences, humanities, policy, and trade literature. In bringing these diverse literatures together, we aim to shed light on the common underlying issues that concern and affect all of these areas. By contextualizing the phenomenon of Big Data within larger socio-economic developments, we also seek to provide a broader understanding of its drivers, barriers, and challenges. This approach allows us to identify attributes of Big Data that need to receive more attention--autonomy, opacity, and generativity, disparity, and futurity--leading to questions and ideas for moving beyond dilemmas.},

It's worth mentioning that art historians were using without knowing it models of influences already in the XIX century. To understand our model it has been necessary to invent new terminology, for example: "power of similarity", "rivers and streams of influences "and" reconstructed overgraphs of influences". The presented model may be useful in any historical study.},

  abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.},

Lang's own networking practice, realized in his casual take on intellectual property and materialized in the multiple authorship of his Fairy Book projects, shows how attending to assemblages rather than individuals might expand conventional models of creative agency in literary studies and enable new configurations of literary-historical time.},

  abstract = {This lecture will present a topography of large-scale author-text networks from the early modern German intelligentsia. To collect data, I use the Dirty History Crawler (DHC) tool, a Python program that constructs, de-duplicates and cleans bibliographic data from WorldCat. The dataset featured here consists of several thousand authors and books. The authors are all of the primary professors of law at the University of Marburg from its inauguration in 1520 through the Napoleonic Wars \textendash{} as well as all people with whom those professors ``co-authored'' texts, meaning essentially whose works they themselves translated, anthologized or otherwise republished, as well as student-mentor co-publications. To situate the analysis of this network, I will give a brief account of the state of scholarship applying network analysis to the study of book history. I will also offer some suggestions for fine-tuning the study of such networks over long periods of time, especially considering time horizons and edge directionality. This is followed finally by a topography \textendash{} a summary of the structure and features \textendash{} of the author-text networks under consideration. The topography focuses on centrality measures and communities.  To give focus to this giant landscape, I will make recourse on several occasions to close consideration of the life and work of two illustrious jurists in this network, namely Hermann Vultejus (a widely connected legal humanist of the 16th century) and Johann Georg Estor (a polymath of the 18th). Finally, I will also briefly introduce the Dirty History Crawler as a tool. DHC has been developed at the Center for Digital Humanities at the University of South Carolina and can be found at http://sc.edu/about/centers/digital\_humanities/projects/dhc.php},

This essay uses mathematical and computational techniques developed by network scientists to reconstruct and analyze the social and textual organization of the underground community of Protestants living in England during the reign of Mary I, using an important body of original letters now held in the British Library and Emmanuel College Library, Cambridge, as well as early printed correspondence. These measures and algorithms reveal certain expected trends, such as the fact that many of the Marian martyrs featuring in John Foxe's famous ``Book of Martyrs'' were central to the organization of this network by every measure. But they also reveal the surprising importance of letter couriers and financial supporters to the survival of this community during a time of intense persecution.},

This is the doctrine of European diffusionism, the belief that the rise of Europe to modernity and world dominance is due to some unique European quality of race, environment, culture, mind, or spirit, and that progress for the rest of the world results from the diffusion of European civilization. J.M. Blaut persuasively argues that this doctrine is not grounded in the facts of history and geography, but in the ideology of colonialism. It is the world model that Europeans constructed to explain, justify, and assist their colonial expansion. This highly readable, illuminating volume will challenge and inform a broad audience that includes general readers. Disputing fundamental ideas in geography, history, anthropology, and the humanities, it is essential reading for professors and students in these fields.},

This approach builds a statistical model of an artist from the scans of a set of authenticated works against which new works then are compared. The statistical model consists of first- and higher-order wavelet statistics. We show preliminary results from our analysis of 13 drawings that at various times have been attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder; these results confirm expert authentications. We also apply these techniques to the problem of determining the number of artists that may have contributed to a painting attributed to Pietro Perugino and again achieve an analysis agreeing with expert opinion.},

  abstract = {This article addresses some of the circumstances, and consequences, of the peculiar authority invested in copperplate prints in the early modern period. At issue are a whole range of kinds of agency and efficacy that were active in early modern thinking about printed images \textendash{} ones which neither `aura' (what mechanical reproduction, by Walter Benjamin's lights, was supposed to rob) nor William M. Ivins Jr.'s account of prints as `exactly repeatable pictorial statements` adequately captures. Sustained attention is paid to the radical recombinability of prints and the competing oeuvres and authorships (constructions inseparable from discrete collections of a printmaker's output) that arose from this fact. A second area of preoccupation is the interalization of printmaking technologies and the proliferation of a set of intaglio metaphors used to conceptualize how sensations were recorded in the mind and retrieved as units of knowledge. The experience of prints figured as both cause and effect of these early modern habits of thought. If the mind was thought to be like an engraved copper plate or a sheet of paper imprinted with figures, it is asked, what of the interface with its material referents? What might be thought to happen when people with print- or plate-like minds looked at printed images? Prints by Abraham Bosse and Clause Mellan supply partial answers.},

This publication discusses the character of Durer's workshop, preferences for drawings in Renaissance Germany, questions about authorship and ownership around works of art and the reception and adaptation of the Northern Renaissance art in the Prague Mannerism. It also demonstrates how in the course of the sixteenth century the evaluation of Durer's drawings in Northern Europe changed."},

And why is history--especially long-term history--so essential to understanding the multiple pasts which gave rise to our conflicted present? The History Manifesto is a call to arms to historians and everyone interested in the role of history in contemporary society. Leading historians David Armitage and Jo Guldi identify a recent shift back to longer-term narratives, following many decades of increasing specialization, which they argue is vital for the future of historical scholarship and how it is communicated. This provocative and thoughtful book makes an important intervention in the debate about the role of history and the humanities in a digital age. It will provoke discussion among policymakers, activists and entrepreneurs as well as ordinary listeners, viewers, readers, students and teachers"--},

  shorttitle = {The {{French Historical Revolution}}},
  abstract = {A remarkable amount of the most innovative, significant, and lasting historical writing of the twentieth century has been produced in France, much of it the work of a group of historians associated with the journal Annales. Founded in 1929, Annales promoted a new kind of history based on three central aims: to substitute a problem-orientated analytical history for a traditional narrative of events; to embrace the history of the whole range of human activities rather than concentrate on political history; and, in order to achieve the first two aims, to collaborate fully with other disciplines - notably geography, sociology, psychology, economics, linguistics, and anthropology. The critical history describes, analyzes, and evaluates the achievements of the Annales school, combining chronological and thematic approaches. The author distinguishes three generations in the history of the Annales movement. In the first phase, from the 1920's to 1945, the movement was small, radical, and subverse, fighting a guerrilla action against traditional political history and the history of events. Its leaders, and the founders of Annales, were Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch. After the Second World War, the movement's rebels took over the historical establishment. During this second phase, which lasted until about 1968, the movement was most nearly a school, with distinctive concepts and methods, and was presided over by the towering figure of Fernand Braudel. The third phase of the movement, which continues today, is marked by fragmentation. Its influence in France had become so great that it lost much of its distinctiveness, and no strong figures appeared to give the movement the inspiration and direction that Febvre, Bloch, and Braudel had provided. Some members of the group even returned to political history and to the narrative of events. The cycle was complete - the rebels became the establishment and were in turn rebelled against.},

  abstract = {Although textiles were key facilitators in global diplomacy in the early modern period, there has been little scholarly consideration of the dynamic role they played in shaping diplomatic relationships during a time when textiles of all types from both east and west were circulating actively as wholesale commodities across world markets. This case study addresses this lacuna by examining the role that textiles, including linens, silks, and tapestries, played in mediating the inter- and intra-cultural diplomatic negotiations of Johan Maurits of Nassau-Siegen (1604-1679), the governor-general of Dutch Brazil from 1637 to 1644. As I argue, the production and dissemination of objects such as linens and especially the \emph{Old Indies} tapestry series, based on designs made under Johan Maurits's patronage, demonstrate how textiles, in their many forms and formats, were uniquely suited to negotiate the dynamic shifts that characterized cross-cultural diplomacy in the early modern period.},

Daring and innovative as a painter, printmaker, and draftsman, he created powerful character studies, genre scenes, landscapes, formal portraits, and religious and allegorical images that were widely praised and valued during his lifetime. This beautiful book, the first overview of the full range of Lievens' career, features more than 50 paintings - many of them newly discovered in private collections - and more than 75 prints and drawings, providing a reassessment of his place in the history of art." "Lievens began his career in his native Leiden, where he worked closely with his compatriot Rembrandt, who admired and collected Lievens' works. Lievens then moved to London, Antwerp, and Amsterdam, and his peripatetic career and multitude of working styles, say the authors of this book, may explain why his reputation today is not as high as it should be. This book offers a necessary corrective, returning to Lievens the esteem he deserves."--BOOK JACKET.},

  abstract = {This article compares the impact of plague across Europe during the seventeenth century. It shows that the disease affected southern Europe much more severely than the north. Italy was by far the area worst struck. Using a new database, the article introduces an epidemiological variable that has not been considered in the literature: territorial pervasiveness of the contagion. This variable is much more relevant than local mortality rates in accounting for the different regional impact of plague. Epidemics, and not economic hardship, generated a severe demographic crisis in Italy during the seventeenth century. Plague caused a shock to the economy of the Italian peninsula that might have been key in starting its relative decline compared with the emerging northern European countries.},

It has identified universal properties of complex networks, and the interplay between their structure and dynamics. After almost twenty years of the field, new challenges lie ahead. These challenges concern the multilayer structure of most of the networks, the formulation of a network geometry and topology, and the development of a quantum theory of networks. Making progress on these aspects of network theory can open new venues to address interdisciplinary and physics challenges including progress on brain dynamics, new insights into quantum technologies, and quantum gravity.},

The study of this artificial universe that tries to look like a real one, helps to understand that there are underlying principles that make real-life networks have definite characteristics.},

  abstract = {This article explores how digital humanities research methods can be used to analyze the representations of gendered bodies in European fairy tales, a flexible and pervasive genre that has influenced Western children's education and acquisition of gender identity for centuries. By blending the theoretical and methodological concerns of folkloristics, gender studies, and large-scale scientific research, this article demonstrates the utility of cross-disciplinary collaboration in asking traditional questions of traditional materials with new methods. To facilitate this research, a hand-coded database listing every reference to a body or body part in the 233 fairy tales was created. Analysis revealed strong indications that the gender and age of fairy-tale protagonists correlate in ways that indicate societal value being placed on certain perspectives, with youthful and masculine perspectives being validated as universal, whereas feminine and aged bodies are often marked as `other'. Feminist scholars have articulated some of these ideas in the past, and this approach allows for a more empirical exploration of such claims.},

  abstract = {Cooper Hewitt reopened at the end of 2014 with a transformed museum in a renovated heritage building, Andrew Carnegie's home on the Upper East Side of New York City. New galleries, a collection that was being rapidly digitized, a new brand, and a desire for new audiences drove the museum to rethink and reposition its role as a design museum. At the core of the new museum is a digital platform, built in-house, that connects collection and patron management systems to in-gallery and online experiences. These have allowed the museum to redesign everything from object labels and showcases to the fundamentals of a 'visit experience'. This paper explores in detail the process, the decisions made \textendash{} and resulting tradeoffs - during each stage of the process. In so doing it reveals the challenges of collaborating with internal and external capacities; operating internationally with online collaboration tools; rapid prototyping; and the distinct differences between software and hardware design and production.},

  abstract = {"Most European countries are rather small, yet we know little about their monetary history. This book analyses for the first time the experience of seven small states (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland) during the last hundred years, starting with the restoration of the gold standard after World War I and ending with Sweden's rejection of the Euro in 2003. The comparative analysis shows that for the most part of the twentieth century the options of policy makers were seriously constrained by a distinct fear of floating exchange rates. Only with the crisis of the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1992-93 did the idea that a flexible exchange rate regime was suited for a small open economy gain currency. The book also analyses the differences among small states and concludes that economic structures or foreign policy orientations were far more important for the timing of regime changes than domestic institutions and policies"-- "1. The book treats a new topic: monetary history of seven small states across the 20th century; 2. It shows the crucial importance of economic ideas and monetary theories in policy making; 3. It has a long-term perspective: 100 years of European monetary history; 4. The results are relevant for the understanding of the current/recent financial and economic crisis"--},

Since the 1990s, KCL's Department of Digital Humanities has been involved in the development of structured prosopographical databases using a general `factoid-oriented' model of structure that links people to the information about them via spots in primary sources that assert that information. Recent developments, particularly the World Wide Web, and its related technologies around the Semantic Web, have promoted the possibility to both interconnecting dispersed data, and allowing it to be queried semantically. To the purpose of making available our prosopographical databases on the Semantic Web, in this article we review the principles behind our established factoid-based model and reformulate it using a more interoperable approach, based on knowledge representation principles and formal ontologies. In particular, we are going to focus primarily on a high-level semantic analysis of the factoid notion, on its relation to other cultural heritage standards such as CIDOC-CRM, and on the modularity and extensibility of the proposed solutions.},

Applying social network analysis to the distributions of imports and other distinctive objects, Emma Blake reveals previously unrecognized exchange networks that are in some cases the precursors of the named peoples of the first millennium BC: the Etruscans, the Veneti, and others. In a series of regional case studies, she uses quantitative methods to both reconstruct and analyze the character of these early networks and posits that, through path dependence, the initial structure of the networks played a role in the success or failure of the groups occupying those same regions in later times. This book thus bridges the divide between Italian prehistory and the Classical period, and demonstrates that Italy's regionalism began far earlier than previously thought"--},

  abstract = {The sheer computing power of modern information technology is changing the face of research not just in science, technology and mathematics, but in humanities and cultural studies too. Recent decades have seen a major shift both in attitudes and deployment of computers, which are now vital and highly effective tools in disciplines where they were once viewed as elaborate typewriters. This revealing volume details the vast array of computing applications that researchers in the humanities now have recourse to, including the dissemination of scholarly information through virtual 'co-laboratories', data retrieval, and the modeling of complex processes that contribute to our natural and cultural heritage. One key area covered in this book is the versatility of computers in presenting images and graphics, which is transforming the analysis of data sets and archaeological reconstructions alike. The papers published here are grouped into three broad categories that cover mathematical and computational methods, research developments in information systems, and a detailed portrayal of ongoing work on documenting, restoring and presenting cultural monuments including the temples in Pompeii and the Banteay Chhmar temples of the Angkorian period in present-day Cambodia. Originally presented at a research workshop in Heidelberg, Germany, they reflect the rapidly developing identity of computational humanities as an interdisciplinary field in its own right, as well as demonstrating the breadth of perspectives in this young and vibrant research area.},

  abstract = {"The dawn of print was a major turning point in the early modern world. It rescued ancient learning from obscurity, transformed knowledge of the natural and physical world, and brought the thrill of book ownership to the masses. But, as Andrew Pettegree reveals, the story of the post-Guttenberg world was rather more complicated than we have often come to believe. The Book in the Renaissance reconstructs the first 150 years of the world of print, exploring the complex web of religious, economic and cultural concerns surrounding the printed word. From its very beginnings, the printed book had to straddle financial and religious imperatives, as well as the very different requirements and constraints of the many countries who embraced it, and, as Pettegree argues, the process was far from a runaway success. More than ideas, the success or failure of books depended upon patrons and markets, precarious strategies and the thwarting of piracy, and the ebb and flow of popular demand. Pettegree crafts an authoritative, lucid and truly pioneering work of cultural history illuminating one of the greatest developments in the evolution of European society."--Book jacket.},

  abstract = {Many large real-world networks actually have a two-mode nature: their nodes may be separated into two classes, the links being between nodes of different classes only. Despite this, and despite the fact that many ad hoc tools have been designed for the study of special cases, very few exist to analyse (describe, extract relevant information) such networks in a systematic way. We propose here an extension of the most basic notions used nowadays to analyse large one-mode networks (the classical case) to the two-mode case. To achieve this, we introduce a set of simple statistics, which we discuss by comparing their values on a representative set of real-world networks and on their random versions. This makes it possible to evaluate their relevance in capturing properties of interest in two-mode networks.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

We document in this paper a very robust correlation: US-born citizens living in metropolitan areas where the share of foreign-born increased between 1970 and 1990, experienced a significant increase in their wage and in the rental price of their housing. Such finding is economically significant and survives omitted variable bias and endogeneity bias. As people and firms are mobile across cities in the long run we argue that, in equilibrium, these correlations are consistent with a net positive effect of cultural diversity on the productivity of natives.},

This book is unique both in the breadth of institutional scope that she attributed to such networks of signification and in the manner through which she folded the notion of the documentary sign back upon the definition of professionalism in documentation and librarianship. Briet's characterization of the documentary sign in terms of institutional and cultural contexts still stands as an open challenge to positivist and simple quantitative notions of "information" within information theory, information science, and information culture, particularly in the United States, since World War II."--Jacket.},

As the authors reveal, mass-produced pictures made it possible for people of all situations to possess them, thereby initiating a change in the role of images that are eventually helped after the definition of art itself."--BOOK JACKET.},

The relationship of these new genres and their favorite themes is linked to cultural issues of ultimate significance and reflects a burgeoning urbanism and capitalism in Antwerp. Silver analyzes how pictorial genres and the Antwerp marketplace fostered the development of what has come to be known as "signature" artistic style. By examining Bosch and Bruegel, together with their imitators, he focuses on pictorial innovation as well as the marketing of individual styles, attending particularly to the growing practice of artists signing their works. In addition, he argues that consumer interest in the style of individual artists reinforced another phenomenon of the later sixteenth century: art collecting. While today we take such typical artistic formulas as commonplace, along with their frequent use of identifying signatures (a Rothko, a Pollock), Peasant Scenes and Landscapes shows how these developed simultaneously in the commercial world of early modern Antwerp."--BOOK JACKET.},

The Dutch pioneered several aspects of economic modernization: a highly productive agriculture, a technically advanced industry, modern public finance, the capital market, and the modern corporation - the Dutch East India Company. Dutch economic history is placed in its European and world context. Comparisons are made with other European countries, and Dutch intercontinental and colonial trade are discussed fully. Special emphasis is placed on the environmental context of economic growth and later decline, as well as on demographic developments.

Thousand of maps were brought almost industrially on the market by Covens \& Mortier and all members of this firm were gifted with a great commercial talent. This book offers an overview of the history of this important publishing company. It focuses on the cartographic stock of Covens \& Mortier and the way that the publications were produced and distributed.

Given a set of circumstances or processes, what other possible network shapes could have emerged? This is the problem of equifinality, where many different means could potentially arrive at the same end result: the networks that we observe. This paper outlines how agent-based modelling can be used as a laboratory for exploring different processes of archaeological network formation. We begin by describing our best guess about how the (ancient) world worked, given our target materials (here, the networks of production and patronage surrounding the Roman brick industry in the hinterland of Rome). We then develop an agent-based model of the Roman extractive economy which generates different kinds of networks under various assumptions about how that economy works. The rules of the simulation are built upon the work of Bang (2006; 2008) who describes a model of the Roman economy which he calls the `imperial Bazaar'. The agents are allowed to interact, and the investigators compare the kinds of networks this description generates over an entire landscape of economic possibilities. By rigorously exploring this landscape, and comparing the resultant networks with those observed in the archaeological materials, the investigators will be able to employ the principle of equifinality to work out the representativeness of the archaeological network and thus the underlying processes.},

Class revolt and fisical crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolidation, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self- interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed.},

Objects rarely stand independently from each other, but are rather interconnected in whole constellations with almost endless associations. It is these associations which we make that instil objects with their power, enabling them to evoke distant times and places for us. However, the immense benefits of object networks are countered by their costs. In objectifying and controlling artefacts in networks, human communities can lose track of the recalcitrant pull that artefacts exercise. Materials do not always do as they are asked. We never fully understand all their aspects. This we grasp in our everyday, unconscious working in the phenomenal world, but overlook in our network thinking. And this failure to attend to things and give them their due can lead to societal 'disorientation'.  Using archaeological case studies from the Bronze Age of Greece throughout, Knappett develops a long-term, archaeological angle on the development of object networks in human societies. He explores both the benefits such networks create for human interaction across scales, and the challenges faced by ancient societies in balancing these benefits against their costs."--Publisher's website.},

This model aids in mapping transnational textual flows at the macroscale but is itself meant to provoke reflection on ``scale'' as a concept that can disrupt the restrictive paradigm of close versus distant reading.},

Elements are treated as nodes which are connected by narrative clauses, represented by arcs. By representing complex event sequences as networks, inducing `narrative networks', it is possible to observe and measure new structural features of narratives. The narratives we focus on are autobiographical accounts of becoming, and being, a Nazi. The substantive idea that we develop in this article is that the observable narrative structure of life stories can provide insight into the process of identity formation. We illustrate our approach to narrative networks by analyzing a single story that, in conjunction with the analysis of other stories, yields a set of insights into becoming and being.},

It traces the development of abstraction as it moved through a network of modern artists, from Marsden Hartley and Marcel Duchamp to Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich, sweeping across nations and across media. This richly illustrated publication covers a wide range of artistic production--including paintings, drawings, books, sculptures, film, photography, sound poetry, atonal music and non-narrative dance--to draw a cross-media portrait of these watershed years. An introductory essay by Leah Dickerman, Curator in the Museum's Department of Painting and Sculpture, is followed by focused studies of key groups of works, events and critical issues in abstraction's early history by renowned scholars from a variety of fields.},

The volume opens with contributions from a historian and an art historian; they examine the weaknesses of an art history without a social or economic history and lay the groundwork for the ensuing discussions of how the procedures and methods of each discipline may serve the aims of the other. A wide critique of approaches to the interpretation of realism in Dutch pictures forms the second section of the book. Included are critical views of recent iconographic developments, as well as contributions by a plant taxonomist and a marine historian. In the volume's third section new statistical and numerical models for the study of Dutch art in Dutch society are presented by three economic historians. The concluding essay provides a constructive critique of existing methodologies within each field. Art in History/History in Art: Studies in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Culture offers the most secure basis to date for future work on the interaction between the two disciplines and between the content of pictures and the cultures that produce them.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of peer influence in the diffusion of the iPhone 3G across a number of communities sampled from a large dataset from a major European Mobile carrier in one country. We identify tight communities of users in which peer influence may play a role and use instrumental variables to control for potential correlation between unobserved subscriber heterogeneity and friends' adoption. We provide evidence that the propensity of a subscriber to adopt increases with the percentage of friends who have already adopted. During a period of 11 months, we estimate that 14\% of the iPhones 3G sold by this carrier were due to peer influence. This result is obtained after controlling for social clustering, gender, previous adoption of mobile Internet data plans, ownership of technologically advanced handsets and heterogeneity in the regions where subscribers move during the day and spend most of their evenings. This result remains qualitatively unchanged when we control for changes over time in the structure of the social network. We provide results from several policy experiments showing that with this level of effect of peer influence the carrier would have hardly benefited from using traditional marketing strategies to seed the iPhone 3G to benefit from viral marketing.},

  abstract = {My dissertation examines the career of the Flemish artist, Aegidius Sadeler, who worked in Germany, Italy, and in Prague as court engraver to the Hapsburg emperors Rudolf II, Matthias and Ferdinand II. Sadeler was regarded by Sandrart, Baldinucci and other writers as one of the finest engravers of his time and as a major influence on printmakers of the 17th century.
Sadeler's reputation lies chiefly in his role in the evolution of the reproductive engraving, a genre of print which originated during the 16th century and increased in popularity with the developing interest in art history. However, the dissertation also considers Sadeler's original prints, as well as his less familiar activity as a draftsman and painter, and brings together a group of securely attributed drawings.
While the introductory chapter outlines the state of the literature, the following sections give a revised account of Sadeler's career, and discuss his large oeuvre with regard to stylistic development and subject matter. Chapter 2 deals with the background and religion of the Sadeler family, their emigration to Germany, and Aegidius's activity at the Munich court. Chapter 3 is concerned with the itineraries of Sadeler's two trips to Italy as well as his second stay in Munich. Chapter 4 deals with Sadeler's richest period of activity as one of the distinguished artists brought together by Emperor Rudolf II, while Chapter 5 considers the little-known period in Prague from 1612 to 1629, during which Sadeler remained a powerful artistic influence in Northern Europe. Chapter 6 surveys Sadeler's assistants and pupils, with suggestions regarding their contributions to his work.
The final chapter analyzes Sadeler's prints in relation to early writings on engraving and artistic theory. Particular attention is given the impact of the theory of imitation on his engraving technique, as well as the early regard for reproductive engraving as a valuable medium of instruction by artists and art historians. The dialogue between writings on art and Sadeler's developing engraving style is central to my arguments regarding this artist's importance.},

  abstract = {This dissertation expands and enhances our current knowledge of artistic training in the early modern period by showing how prints were used for the education of artists in seventeenth-century Flanders and, by extension, seventeenth-century Europe. In addition to the history of artistic training, this dissertation addresses fundamental questions about how visual sources were used by early modern artists and about how individual pictorial style was constructed and transmitted.
The narrative arc that I trace begins with Rubens's early training under the lingering structure of the guild system and ends with the reception of Rubens's pictorial style through printed drawing books, whose popularity ascended as the establishment of the institutionalized art academy was cemented. I begin by examining the role of an apprentice's master in the process of learning to draw at the turn of the seventeenth century. Centered on the drawings of Rubens's teachers, the first chapter considers the nature of the instruction that Rubens received. I turn in my second chapter to Rubens's earliest works, pen-drawn copies after prints and illustrated books. These drawings show how Rubens expanded his visual frame of reference and developed his mastery of drawing in the unforgiving medium of pen and ink. It was his early study of prints and printed books, I argue, that set Rubens on a path of life-long engagement with the art of printmaking and the practice of print collecting.
In my third chapter, I propose a reconstruction of Rubens's print collection; again, my methodology depends on evidence found in copy drawings in addition to documentary sources. This reconstruction has implications not only for our understanding of Rubens and his workshop, but for the collection, display, and use of prints by seventeenth-century artists and virtuosi. The final chapter examines Rubens's collaboration with his printmakers, one of whom, I argue, distilled the study collection of the Rubens workshop for more public distribution in the form of a printed drawing book. Unpublished copy drawings after these prints attest to how printed drawing books were studied in late seventeenth-century Flanders, a practice that is markedly different from Rubens's idiosyncratic selection and study of printed models.
Taken together, the circulation of printed models, the formation of print collections, and the rise of the new genre of the printed drawing book demonstrate the centrality of prints for artistic training in the seventeenth century.},

  abstract = {This dissertation explores the phenomenon of pen imitation traceable from the late sixteenth to the late seventeenth century first in the Southern and subsequently in the Northern Netherlands. Over two dozen artists working in print, drawing, and painting, challenged the boundaries between these media by means of their highly illusionistic manual factures. Chapter 1 examines how, during the latter half of the sixteenth century, specialized engravers began to reproduce virtuosic calligraphic handwriting in print, resulting in works of high similitude in like manner to facsimiles. Conversely, draftsmen working in pen and ink imitated or alluded in varying degrees to different print techniques in meticulously finished stand-alone works. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 address various modes of pen handling that provide a spectrum of referentiality to print. After Jan Wierix began to imitate the delicate linear style of his family's print shop in Flanders, this practice was adopted and refined in the Northern Netherlands by the great printmaker Hendrick Golztius and his followers. By the middle of the seventeenth century, draftsmen like Gerrit and Willem de Heer continued working in this tradition of pen imitation but also adopted certain pictorial strategies from contemporary painting. Chapter 5 details how around 1650, imitative pen drawing was translated to panel and canvas, resulting in pen paintings in the marine genre.
This dissertation is the first scholarly study to consider calligraphic prints, print-like pen drawings, and pen paintings together and in depth, and to argue that these were part of a related, innovative phenomenon of pen imitation traceable over the course of a century in the North. The thesis adds to the current Goltzius-centered literature on imitative pen drawings by showing that many lesser-known artists engaged in comparable practices, thereby revealing that this phenomenon was more widespread and versatile than previously assessed. More broadly, the study seeks to expand our understanding of artworks from this period as products of a single, identifiable medium. Collectively, the objects considered reveal that the boundaries between media were purposefully kept fluid and that a single artwork could encompass or evoke several material practices.},

  shorttitle = {Innovation and {{Popularization}}},
  abstract = {This dissertation surveys the work and lives of four printmakers and one print publisher, all active in Haarlem in the 1620s: Willem Akersloot, Cornelis van Kittensteyn, Cornelis Koning, Gillis van Scheyndel and Jan Pietersz Berendrecht. It examines the success of their endeavors in the print trade, as well as their failure to remain in that field in the long run. Their prints, which have been little studied, are diverse, covering a wide range of image types from landscape and costume to portraiture and current events. These images participate in many of the established traditions of printed imagery, while they also helped to define the evolving genres of seventeenth-century Dutch art.
Chapter one examines the fertile conditions that made Haarlem a magnet for artists in the early seventeenth century. Connections are made between the legend of the invention of the printing press in Haarlem, the predominance of printmaking and the origins of Dutch landscape art there. Chapter two describes the printed output of the printmakers, starting with a discussion of so-called genre depictions, which are often overlooked in the intensity of the focus on landscape in Haarlem.
Jan Pietersz Berendrecht's life and his activities in the art and print trade are the subject of chapter three. He played a critical role in the etching career of Esaias van de Velde, and hence in the history of Dutch landscape art. A printer, not a printmaker and a founding member of the book trades guild established in Haarlem in 1616, he only published prints until about 1630, after which he gradually sold off his plates to other publishers and moved to The Hague, where he had already been doing business for many years. In chapter four the lives of the four printmakers in question are examined, nearly all of whom came from upwardly mobile families. They started their careers around 1620, but the information presented here reveals that they too stopped making prints around 1630, one by one moving on to other careers.},

  copyright = {Copyright ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing 2011},
  abstract = {Nicolaes de Bruyn (1571-1656) produced nearly three hundred prints in the fifty-eight years between his first dated engraving of 1592 to his final dated work of 1650. He had begun his training in Antwerp, where he was born, and was active in that city until 1617, when he moved from the southern, Catholic Netherlands to the northern, Protestant city of Rotterdam. Early in his career, de Bruyn produced small-scale, mostly serial works after his own designs and after the leading print designer of the day, Marten de Vos. After 1600, de Bruyn spent the next five decades honing his specialty as he produced startlingly large-scale engravings depicting forest landscapes. He initially engraved prints after some of the most famous landscape painters of the day, Gillis van Coninxloo and David Vinckboons. By around 1607, however, he had turned away from copying other artists' compositions to designing his own engravings. Furthermore, aside from a few early mythological and genre scenes, the vast majority of de Bruyn's large engravings after about 1600 depicted religious narratives.
De Bruyn has been neglected until this point largely because his life and work often fall between categories established by scholars for studying the history of printmaking. He worked as both a reproductive engraver and an independent designer-engraver at the same time. Because of his work after other artists, de Bruyn has been branded a reproductive engraver, and he appears almost exclusively in scholarship that deals with the work of the painters or print designers of his reproductive engravings. Furthermore, because he made both large-scale, single-leaf landscapes and small-scale, serial prints, reconciling his early and late work presents a challenge. Finally, de Bruyn worked as a professional engraver during a time when our attention has focused on painter-printmakers in general, and on painter-etchers in particular. To his contemporaries and on the market, however, de Bruyn was a printmaker with a distinctive niche, with little competition. Few printmakers after the 1620s regularly made large-scale landscape prints and none did so in such a sustained manner as de Bruyn.},

  shorttitle = {Tabletop {{Still Lifes}} in {{Haarlem}}, c. 1610--1660},
  abstract = {Scholars have considered Dutch still life and its meaning from a variety of methodological perspectives and have often reached different opinions on the prevalence of intentional moralizing meaning in these pictures. This study approaches meaning--that is, messages specifically religious or moralizing in nature--in still-life painting by focusing on paintings produced in Haarlem between 1610 and 1660 and assessing their capacity for meaning in terms of their visual structure and the objects featured in them.
Drawing on a database of 630 paintings created for this study, I analyzed the patterns that developed in Haarlem tabletop still-life painting; from the objects and foods used in these paintings to their thematic types and compositional characteristics. The results of these analyses foster an understanding of the most typical forms of the Haarlem tabletop still life. However, these analyses also permit one to identify works exceptional in visual structure and/or use of objects that convey unmistakable messages focused on christological and vanitas themes.
A prime example of a painting with these qualities is a large canvas by the artist Willem Claesz. Heda (1635--National Gallery of Art, Washington). The compositional structure in this picture focuses one's attention on a roll along the front edge of the table. A contrast between the roll and the rest of the table is evident: the latter has been consumed while the former is untouched. The presence of elements connoting transience--an extinguished candle and a broken berckemeier --underscores the allegorical nature of this painted table and sharpens the contrast between the roll as symbol of Christ and the rest of the table as a worldly, ephemeral indulgence.
While most tabletop still lifes painted in Haarlem between 1610 and 1660 were not overtly allegorical, a significant number were. The methodology in this study allows one to identify these paintings and assess the nature of their meaning.},

  abstract = {This survey begins with a brief history of the rediscovery in the nineteenth century of the church, guild, and other secular archives that supplied the foundations for the contemporary study of the social and economic environment of Netherlandish art. The second section discusses the various methods - some more sophisticated, some less - that have been, or can be, applied in putting the facts collected in archival research in a wider context and in directing the search for more useful data. In the third section, I discuss and criticize the more important syntheses devoted to the sociology and economics of Netherlandish art by various scholars from the time of Hanns Floerke on. The fourth section reviews recent work on economic factors in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century art in the southern Netherlands. The article concludes with an outline and discussion of quantitative research carried out in the last few years on the guilds and on the "arts industries" in the Dutch Republic.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to remove a constraint of applying network approach to art history. First, it points out, although old diagrams of art history did not use the language of modern network theory, they have already shown ingenuous network thinking to theorize the development of arts. Meanwhile, the indirect visual devices and the embracive tradition of these diagrams, which includes entities in various properties, prevent the application of computer-aided network methods to decipher and re-analyze the contents of this heritage of art historical research. To break this shackle, this paper suggests a multi-mode network approach to ``translate'' the traditional network thinking of art diagrams to the conceptualization of graph-theoretical network analysis. By doing so, this paper demonstrates how art historical research could benefit from modern sociological approach to network theory. To explain the usefulness and advantage of this method, the diagrams of Covarrubias and Barr are taken as examples to be converted into graph-theoretical networks.},

  abstract = {Art in History/History in Art: Studies in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Culture considers the potential for a reciprocally illuminating relationship between art history and history in light of recent methodological developments in both fields. The volume opens with contributions from a historian and an art historian; they examine the weaknesses of an art history without a social or economic history and lay the groundwork for the ensuing discussions of how the procedures and methods of each discipline may serve the aims of the other. A wide critique of approaches to the interpretation of realism in Dutch pictures forms the second section of the book. Included are critical views of recent iconographic developments, as well as contributions by a plant taxonomist and a marine historian. In the volume's third section new statistical and numerical models for the study of Dutch art in Dutch society are presented by three economic historians. The concluding essay provides a constructive critique of existing methodologies within each field. Art in History/History in Art: Studies in Seventeenth-Century Dutch Culture offers the most secure basis to date for future work on the interaction between the two disciplines and between the content of pictures and the cultures that produce them.},

  abstract = {The development of a professionalized, highly centralized printmaking industry in northern Europe during the mid-sixteenth century has been argued to be the inevitable result of prints' efficacy at reproducing images, and thus encouraging mass production. However, it is unclear whether such a centralized structure was truly inevitable, and if it persisted through the seventeenth century. This paper uses network analysis to infer these historical print production networks from two large databases of existing prints in order to characterize whether and how centralization of printmaking networks changed over the course of this period, and how these changes may have influenced individual printmakers.},
