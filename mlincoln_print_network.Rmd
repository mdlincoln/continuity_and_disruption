# Introduction

>There is no better means whereby the painter himself can make his renowned name known: Namely, that he sometimes, using time and diligence for this purpose, engraves one of his celebrated compositions of drawing in print: Because it can go through the whole world, coming into every art lovers' hands, while paintings almost always remain in one place...[^goeree]

[^goeree]: Unless otherwise indicated, translations are mine. "Daer is oock noch een ander middel, waer door den Schilder hem selven een Vermaerden Naem kan maecken: Namentlijck dat hy somtijts, tijt ende vlijt daer toe aenwent, om eenige van sijn feste ordinantien en teyckeningen in print uyt te geven: Want vermits die de geheele Werelt door-wandelen, en in alle Liefhebbers handen komen, en dat de Schidleryen meest altijt maer in eene plaets blijven... [@goeree1670, 125]"

>...release your works freely into print, so that your name will sooner fly over the world. Albrecht Dürer and Lucas van Leyden, though wondrous painters, obtained their greatest fame from engraving.[^hoog]

[^hoog]: "...laet dan vry uwe werken in print uitkomen, zoo zal uwen naem te spoediger al de werelt over vliegen. _Albert Durer_ en _Lukas van Leyden_, wondere Schilders, hebben nochtans hun grootste gerucht door het graefyzer verkreegen."; [@hoogstraten1678, 195]

>Regarding [prints'] effect: what fame is to the ear, theirs is to the eye. Painting has but one result, but engraving hundreds. Fame can tell the many wonders of painting in its absence; but engraving makes itself present everywhere; it flies the world over, as it sounds the echoing trumpet of renown.[^lairesse]

[^lairesse]: "Wat haare uitwerking aangaat, zy is voor het gezicht het geen de Faam voor het gehoor is. De Schilderkonst heeft maar een Origineel, maar de Graveerkunde honderden. De Faam kan van de Schilderkonst veele wonderen vertellen in haar afweezen: maar de Graveerkunde maakt zich overal tegenwoordig. Zy vliegt zo wel de geheele waereld over, als de klank der galmende trompet des Geruchts."; @lairesse1712, 2:372--373

Late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Dutch art commentators Willem Goeree, Samuel van Hoogstraten, and Gérard de Lairesse uniformly agreed on the power of prints to transmit an artist's images far and wide.
Thanks to the relative ease of moving finished impressions, prints had been a mainstay of the international art market in Europe for more than a century and a half.
At the renowned Frankfurt book fair, prominent book publishers even included special sections in their inventory lists devoted to artistic prints and engraved maps.[@paisey2006, 54--55.]
The _consumption_ of prints was clearly internationalized by the early 1500s.
To what extent, however, was their _production_ internationalized?

Starting from the focal point of the northern Netherlands, this paper will offer a novel perspective on the interconnection of print production communities within the larger early modern European world of printmaking.
Computational network analysis offers an alternative framework for understanding the multiple scales, and velocities, of organizational changes among print designers, plate cutters, and publishers, both within and between regional communities.
Comparing the timing and intensity of these changes to traditional narratives about the rise of, say, the concentrated domestic Dutch printmaking community, reveals an alternative history of the emergence of the northern Netherlands as an artistic printmakng capital.
More crucially, we can better gauge whether these changes in this production balance determined by specific historical events, or, rather, subject to larger structural incentives coupled to _longue durée_ population shifts across Europe over this period.
Thus, rather than reifying ahistorical national labels assigned by modern art historians, this data-driven approach productively troubles those categorizations by comparing those post-hoc national classifications to the communities of production described by the objects themselves.

# Dutch Internationalism / Dutch Regionalism

The early history of Netherlandish printmaking is tightly interwoven with international influences.
Lucas van Leyden attracted international acclaim for his masterful handling of the burin.
Among his admirers was no less than the Nuremberg master Albrecht Dürer, as well as the Italian Marcantonio Raimondi.[@marlier1971, 29; on Marcantonio's quotation of Lucas, see @barnes2010, 16.]

Beyond these individual artistic connections, collaborative print production began to take on international dimensions with the rise of large print production houses and the professionalization of engraving in the mid-sixteenth century.
Some Dutch printmakers had built thriving careers creating engravings for Italian painters in Venice and Rome, enjoying the fruits of northern Europeans' reputation, promulgated by Giorgio Vasari, for printmaking prowess.[@landau1983; @gregory2012, 2--4.]
For example, Cornelis Cort, in Rome from 1565--1578, found great success as a printmaker for major Italian painters such as Titian, Giulio Clovio, Girolamo Muziano, and Federico Zuccaro.[@sellink1994; @sman2005, 251--252]
In addition to German and Italian centers, the mid-sixteenth-century publishing house of Hieronymus Cock, _Aux Quatre Vents_, frequently contracted with Dutch engravers such as Philips Galle to produce plates to be published in Antwerp.[For example, during his early career in Haarlem between 1557--1570, Philips Galle engraved several prints to be published in Antwerp by Cock; @sellink1997]
The Haarlem master Hendrick Goltzius would continue this model of remote collaboration even after setting up his own independent studio in 1582.
The well-known collaboration between Hendrick Goltzius and Bartholomeus Spranger, court painter to Rudolf II, illustrates how the design, cutting, and marketing of a print could easily take on an international scope.[@leeflang2003, 82--83, cat. 28] (Figure \@ref(fig:goltzius-wedding))

[Insert figure \@ref(fig:goltzius-wedding) here.]

(ref:goltzius-wedding) Hendrick Goltzius, after Bartholomeus Spranger, *The Wedding Feast of Cupid and Psyche*, 1587. Engraving,  43.5 cm. x 86.1 cm. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.

```{r goltzius-wedding, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap="(ref:goltzius-wedding)"}
include_graphics("assets/images/goltzius_wedding.jpg")
```

[Insert figure \@ref(fig:evdv) here.]

(ref:evdv) Esaias van de Velde, *Fort with defenses at Tholen on the Scheldt*, 1615--1616. Etching, 8.3 x 16.9 cm. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.

```{r evdv, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.cap="(ref:evdv)"}
include_graphics("assets/images/evdv.jpg")
```

But portions of this printmaking community also developed strong domestic connections as well.
In the first decades of the seventeenth century, Haarlem printmakers Claesz Jansz Visscher, Esaias van de Velde I, Willem Buytewech, Hercules Segers, and Jan van de Velde II, began to produce their own versions of the local, rustic landscape view first popularized by Hieronymus Cock in Antwerp.[@freedberg1980, 11--15; @levesque1994, ch. 6.; on the relationship of the anonymously-designed _Small Landscapes_ to the printed landscape tradition in Haarlem, see @onuf2011; @onuf2014] (Figure \@ref(fig:evdv))
All of these printmakers joined the Haarlem guild in 1612, forming a critical mass of pioneering talent.
In the following decades, an increasing number of Dutch engraver-publishers such as Hendrick Hondius and Crispijn de Passe cultivated stocks of plates primarily produced by fellow Dutch artists.[@orenstein1996, 47.]

To what extent, however, can this handful individuals be taken to stand for the overall balance of international vs. domestically-focused Dutch print production partnerships at different points in time?
It is all too easy to generate opposing plausible historical scenarios that would explain either increasing international connections by Dutch designers, plate cutters, and publishers - or, on the other hand, their increased domesticization.

In the late sixteenth century, the northern Netherlands entered a golden age of economic growth thanks to their unmatched control of international sea trade around the world.
Several waves of Dutch artists traveled south to study and paint in Italy, establishing an expatriate community in Rome.[On seventeenth-century Dutch artists' interest in Italy, see @schatborn2001; @harwood2002. Moreover, as their prosperity increased, many Dutch authors, musicians, and artists sought to add internationalizing elements to their works as a way of asserting Dutch cultural legitimacy in the broader world of early modern Europe; see @kettering1983]
Prominent Dutch and Flemish portraitists found many patrons in the English court, and printmakers from the Low Countries were in particular demand in London.
Likewise, foreign publishers and print sellers may have found the thriving Northern Netherlands a particularly attractive market.[@hoftijzer2001, 251--252.]

One might postulate, though, that _domestic_ production would instead come to dominate Dutch printmaking.
The political environment may not have been as conducive to the flow of prints across international borders as the previous scenario suggests.
The start of the Dutch revolt against Spain in 1568 may have made it more difficult for artists in the Low Countries to conduct international business, from the early transmission of contracts and drawn designs to the large shipments of finished impressions required for a successful printmaking business.
The flourishing economy supported a blossoming print industry in Amsterdam, in particular.[@hoftijzer2001, 249.]
With avenues to international collaboration curtailed, and an increasing amount of domestic supply _and_ demand in centers like Haarlem and Amsterdam, Dutch printmakers and publishers may have been encouraged to make more domestic connections than ever before.
Now, rather than having to turn to international partners to produce prints, Dutch artists, printmakers, and publishers could increasingly work with their own countrymen.[A flourishing Dutch art market, both in Amsterdam as well as in smaller towns like Utrecht and Delft, appears to have supported a more decentralized print production network than had existed in the late sixteenth century. It is possible that this same decentralization may have spurred more domestic collaboration as well; @lincoln2016-dah]

In the absence of a single intuitive and convincing historical answer, we can turn to network analysis to provide an alternate scale of evidence.

# Operationalizing International Interaction

Computational network analysis is a discipline that attempts to formalize, or operationalize, the description of networks.[I use the term "operationalizing" in the sense discussed by @moretti2013-1.]
When applied to historical subjects, network analysis can recast the way we describe the behaviors of individuals and groups, and alter the narratives we use to explain historical events.[@hanneman2005, 45--50]
Over the past few decades, historians have begun to evaluate earlier, loosely-defined conceptions of networks against mathematical network models constructed from historic records, most notably John Padgett's work with both Christopher Ansell and Paul McLean on social networks in Renaissance Florence.[@padgett1996; @padgett2006; For an historiography of historical social network analysis, see @wetherell1998; @lemercier2011]

While the concept of "network" may seem familiar to many art historians - whether networks of stylistic influence, of artist families and studios, or of patronage and collecting - computational network analysis demands precise definitions of who or what comprises the members of a network, and precisely what evidence is used to infer connections between those members.
The benefit to adopting these strictures, however, is that it permits us to see the complex topological characteristics of the resulting network (e.g. how centralized or decentralized it is, the degree of interconnection between its constituent groups, and which members act as key brokers of connections between disparate communities) that are invisible from the ground-level perspective afforded when considering relationships one at a time.

## Data: Forming Network(s)

Understanding precisely what is included --- and what is not --- in source data is essential when interpreting the results of any one quantitative network measurement.
The data for this study have been drawn from the collections of the British Museum in London (hereafter BM) and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (hereafter RKM). (Table \@ref(tab:nationality-counts))
Both of these collections feature broad and deep collections of European prints (and Dutch and Flemish prints in particular) from this period.
Moreover, each museum has released meticulous curatorial data about these collections amenable to computational processing.

(ref:nationality-counts) Counts of artists (and prints) by nationality in the BM and RKM datasets.

```{r nationality-counts, include = TRUE}
bm_nats <- c("Dutch", "Flemish", "English", "French", "German", "Italian")

rkm_nats <- c("Noord-Nederlands", "Zuid-Nederlands", "Engels", "Frans", "Duits", "Italiaans")

names(bm_nats) <- rkm_nats

bm_print_count <- bm_print_nodes %>% 
  inner_join(bm_node_nationalities, by = "id") %>% 
  filter(nationality %in% bm_nats) %>% 
  inner_join(bm_print_edges, by = c("id" = "source")) %>% 
  group_by(nationality) %>% 
  summarize(
    bm_n_artists = n_distinct(id), 
    bm_n_prints = n_distinct(object))

rkm_print_count <- rkm_artist_attributes %>% 
  filter(nationality %in% rkm_nats) %>% 
  mutate(nationality = plyr::revalue(nationality, bm_nats)) %>% 
  inner_join(rkm_print_edges, by = c("name" = "source")) %>% 
  group_by(nationality) %>% 
  summarize(
    rkm_n_artists = n_distinct(name),
    rkm_n_prints = n_distinct(object_id))

bm_print_count %>% 
  inner_join(rkm_print_count, by = "nationality") %>% 
  mutate(
    BM = paste0(bm_n_artists, " (", format(bm_n_prints, big.mark = ",", trim = TRUE), ")"),
    RKM = paste0(rkm_n_artists, " (", format(rkm_n_prints, big.mark = ",", trim = TRUE), ")")) %>% 
  select(nationality, `BM artists (prints)` = BM, `RKM artists (prints)` = RKM) %>% 
  kable(caption = "(ref:nationality-counts)")
  
```

Each print in the collection is treated as evidence of a professional relationship (whether direct or indirect) at a certain point in time.
For example, the print in Figure \@ref(fig:goltzius-wedding) would be used to create a connection between Hendrick Goltzius and Bartholomeus Spranger during the year of 1587.[For an in-depth discussion of these data and the methodology for inferring production networks from object-based collections, see @lincoln2016-dah, 138-141. As explained there, I will be keeping the BM and RKM datasets separate, running the same analysis in parallel and comparing the results from each. This will function as a check against the particular collecting histories of each institution. Where we see similar results from both institutions, we can be more confident that the results aren't merely artifacts of one colleciton's peculiar lineage. Where we see diverging results, we will need to be more conservative when interpreting it.]
Rather than producing a single network encompassing every constitutent and connection from 200 years of print production, we can instead construct snapshots, or slices, of the network as it may have appeared in a given period of time based on the surviving evidence that we have.
In this way, it is possible to chart the change in certain network-wide metrics over time.

[Insert figure \@ref(fig:timeslice) here.]

(ref:timeslice) Example time slices of print production networks.

```{r timeslice, fig.cap="(ref:timeslice)", fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
include_graphics("assets/images/timeslice_examples.png")
```

Such a picture is inevitably flattening; it necessitates discarding a great deal of information.
For example, the production network discussed here is precisely that, a _production-focused_ network, rather than one that incorporates information about familial relationships, or financial relatinoships, or social relationships such as co-membership in a given parish or guild.
This approach is, moreover, topological, rather than topographical: spatial information is not explicitly considered in this particular analysis.
But, as with an X-radiograph of a painting, with the loss of some information comes the gain of information othewise unseen.
Careful focus on the patterns of print co-production will, in fact, offer us a much broader structural context misisng from other information-rich, but scale-poor, studies.
Together, both perspectives are more valuable than either one seen alone.

## Measurement: External/Internal Interaction

When, and to what extent, do actors who belong to one category make connections to each other, versus to actors in another?
This is a common question in network analysis, and can be measured by using the group-external/group-internal index (hereafter called the "EI index").[See, for example, @matos2014, 15]
The EI index measures the balance between the number connections actors made within a specified group (in this case, nationality) versus those they made to actors outside that group.[^krackhardt] (Figure \@ref(fig:eii-example))
This index can work at several scales.
It can be used to quantify an entire group's propensity to connect with other groups (e.g. Dutch artists connecting to non-Dutch artists).
A positive EI index indicates that nodes within that group made most of their connections to nodes belonging to other groups, while a negative EI index indicates those nodes made most of their connections internally.
One can also measure the EI index of a single individual, comparing the number of connections they make to members of their own group, versus to those belonging to another.

[^krackhardt]: The EI index comprises the ratio of the difference between the number of a group's external ($n_e$) and internal ($n_i$) links to the total number of links the group makes:
$$\epsilon = \frac{n_e - n_i}{n_e + n_i}$$

    Originally proposed in [@krackhardt1988, 127--129]; also see [@hanneman2005, 128--132].

[Insert figure \@ref(fig:eii-example) here.]

(ref:eii-example) A network with three groups of 20 nodes each. Group A is densely interconnected, so while its members do make some external connections, by in large they connect to each other. Therefore, that group has a negative EI index. Nodes in group B, on the other hand, make a slim majority of their connections _externally_, giving that group a positive index. Nodes in group C connect exclusively to each other, and so that group has the lowest possible EI index of -1.

```{r eii-example, fig.cap="(ref:eii-example)"}
a <- sample_gnm(20, 50)
V(a)$class <- "A"

b <- sample_gnm(20, 8)
V(b)$class <- "B"

d <- sample_gnm(20, 30)
V(d)$class <- "C"

x <- a + b + d
new_edges <- as.vector(rbind(sample(1:20, 10, replace = FALSE), b = sample(21:40, 10, replace = FALSE)))
x <- add_edges(x, new_edges)

pal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, name = "Dark2")
names(pal) <- c("A", "B", "C")
V(x)$color <- plyr::revalue(V(x)$class, pal)
V(x)$label <- ""
V(x)$label.color <- "#ffffff"

ext_links <- function(g, classval) {
  length(E(g)[V(g)[class == classval] %--% V(g)[class != classval]])
}

int_links <- function(g, classval) {
  length(E(g)[V(g)[class == classval] %--% V(g)[class == classval]])
}

eii <- function(ext, int) {
  (ext - int) / (ext + int)
}

a_int <- int_links(x, "A")
a_ext <- ext_links(x, "A")
a_eii <- eii(a_ext, a_int)

b_int <- int_links(x, "B")
b_ext <- ext_links(x, "B")
b_eii <- eii(b_ext, b_int)

c_int <- int_links(x, "C")
c_ext <- ext_links(x, "C")
c_eii <- eii(c_ext, c_int)

layout(matrix(c(1, 2), 2, 1, byrow = TRUE), heights = c(2.5,1))
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(x, vertex.size = 7)
par(mar = c(6, 3, 0, 3))
barplot(c(a_eii, b_eii, c_eii), xlab = "<- More Internal       EI Index       More External ->", ylab = "Group", names.arg = c("A", "B", "C"), col = pal, xlim = c(-1, 1), horiz = TRUE)
```

It is crucial to reiterate that one must always approach with caution categorizations such as "artist nationalities" coded by modern-day researchers.
Demarcating the borders of nationality in the early modern period is an inherently tricky problem, perhaps no more so than in the case of the Low Countries during the age of the Eighty Years War.[On the challenge of constructing the right national context for Netherlandish printmakers in particular, see @kok2015, 348.]
The Dutch 1581 Act of Abjuration (in the wake of the Union of Utrecht two years prior) marks the official schism between the seventeen United Provinces in the northern Netherlands and the territories of the Spanish-controlled southern Netherlands.
And while this break is a convenient historical landmark, it was soon followed by large waves of emigration from the south as Protestants and other non-Catholics fled religious persecution in Antwerp for the relatively more tolerant north.
Many of these migrants were painters like Gillis van Coninxloo, Clara Peeters, and Roelandt Savery, who had an abiding impact on artistic development in the United Provinces.

Flemish printmakers also emigrated to the north, including Nicolaes de Bruyn and Jan van Londerseel, both of whom moved to Rotterdam.[Londerseel by 1610, and De Bruyn by 1617; @vandercoelen1996, 24]
As noted earlier, Flemish landscapes were a crucial inspiration for the popular idiom of local Dutch countryside print series that were popularized by Haarlem printmakers in the 1610s.[On this influence, see @sluijter2009; @porras2013; @onuf2014.]
To split artists from these two countries can be an arbitrary division.[It is also worth noting that, for many foreign patrons, "Dutch" or "Flemish" was a distinction without a difference.
See, for example, Italian disagreement over whether Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst should be referred to as Flemish ("Gerardo Fiammingo") or Dutch ("Gerardo Olandese"): @lincoln2016-source.]

On the other hand, the distinction was important indeed for Dutch guild leaders who feared that the sudden influx of well-trained artisans from Antwerp at the turn of the century would flood the Dutch market.
As a result, they planned regulations to protect native Dutch artists from this new competition.[@sluijter2009]
The division has also remained undeniably useful for art historians, and is reflected in the datasets used for this analysis.[^bmdf]

[^bmdf]: Both the BM and the RKM database differentiate between "Dutch"/"Noord-Nederlands" and "Flemish"/"Zuid-Nederlands" artists.
While the RKM assigns only one nationality per artist, the BM allows artists to take multiple nationalities, though only six printmaking artists have been tagged as both "Dutch" and "Flemish": Nicolas de Bruyn, Daniel van den Bremden, Egbert van Panderen, Gijsbert van Veen, and Hans Bol. In cases where artists have been assigned multiple nationalities in the source data, they will be counted as both a domestic and an international when calculating the EI index, erring on the side of retaining as many potentially-pertinent links as possible, at the cost of slightly overstating the impact of mulitply-classified individuals.

For the purposes of this analysis, I will use the present database classifications.
But it is critical to understand that these classifications will be a factor to be _tested_ in this analysis, rather than aceppted as a foundational truth.[^belgian]
The modern metadata about each artist in this network may assign the artist to a particular national/regional community.
But how do the communities defined by these post-hoc labels compare to the relationships, and the communities that emerge from said relationships, inferred from the production evidence of the objects considered here?
If these modern national classifications were, indeed, "correct" in describing communities of print production, i.e., if the "national school" framework of art history were one that fit well the actual production practices of prints in the early modern period, then we would expect to find persistently negative EI indices, indicating majority-internal connections.

[^belgian]: Both the RKM and BM begin to classify artists born in the Austrian Netherlands (post-1715) as "Belgian/Begisch", however there are only a small handful of such artists whose work falls into the 1550--1750 period examined here.
For the purposes of this analysis, these few artists will be treated as Flemish.

As we will see, these modern labels do not overlay comfortably over the topological communities in thiese production networks.
However, by understanding _when_ these production communities diverge from present-day classifications, we will gain a novel perspective on this golden age of Europoean printmaking.

# Results: Catalysts and Sudden Shifts

(ref:all-nats-eii) The EI Index for Dutch, Flemish, French, British, German, and Italian printmaking communities between 1550--1750. At 1, all connections made by an actor are to actors outside their national group. At 0, they have an equal number of internal and external connections. At -1, all their connections are to actors within their national group.

```

Figure \@ref(fig:all-nats-eii) plots the changing EI index for Dutch, Flemish, French, British, German, and Italian printmaking communities between 1550--1750, comparing the trends observed from both the BM and RKM datasets.
Both museum databases return roughly equivalent results for both the Dutch and Flemish printmaking communities.
Expanding our scope to look at other major European regions, the BM and RKM datasets also roughly agree on the EI index for French, German, and Italian print production; though given the greater disparity between their trends, it will be critical not to overinterpret small year-to-year shifts.
The only major discrepancy between the two datasets is for the EI index of the English printmaking community.
Given the vast superiority of the BM's holdings in English prints (Table \@ref(tab:nationality-counts)), the trend observed from the BM data is likely more representative than that observed from the RKM.

Dutch artists primarily connected to foreign collaborators up until the 1570s, when they shifted quickly to a roughly even split between domestic versus foreign connections.
After this sudden shift, Dutch artists and printmakers continued to favor mostly domestic collaborators, hovering around an EI index of -0.5.
That is, after this major shift they tended to make at least 75% of their connections to fellow Dutchmen.
The group of artists classed as Flemish presents a rough inverse of this pattern, making most of their connections internally in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, before quickly shifting around 1675 to majority-external connections.

These results support the hypothesis that Dutch printmaking experienced a domestic "turn" not only in subject and style, but also in the infrastructure of print production itself.
Two details are particularly noteworthy.
It is somewhat surprising to note that this turn occurred in the 1570s, well before the commonly-acknowledged burst of particularly "domestic" subjects in Haarlem in the 1610s.
Even more surprising is how swiftly this landscape of print production changed.
Within just a few years, Dutch artists moved from making over three-quarters of their connections to foreign sources, to a roughly even split.
We see a similarly precipitate turn in the Southern Netherlands in the mid-seventeenth century --- but towards more international production, rather than more domestic.

Indeed, we can observe rapid shifts from majority-external to majority-internal printmaking collaboration in the French and English communities that are quite similar to the pattern seen in the northern Netherlands.
Both the French and English communities also begin this period making most of their connections externally, but each underwent their own separate, inward shifts at 1620 and 1650, respectively.
The German and Italian print production networks, on the other hand, began this period internally-connected, only to trend gradually towards more external connections.

No one single historical event appears to have catalyzed simultaneous shifts across any of these communities.
However, before attempting to interpret these trends, it is crucial to distinguish between those shifts that we might expect to see in _any_ network of similar size and distribution of groups, versus those changes that are unexpected, and which might be attributable to some outside historical event.

# Simulating Production Networks

Although specific historical events surely affected patterns of production between printmakers and publishers from different countries, political changes or military conflicts were short-term happenings that occurred within a landscape of equally-influential long-term incentives and population trends.[This draws, of course, on the French _Annales_ school of history. On the relevance of digital history to _longue durée_ approaches, see @guldi2014.]
In other words, the effects of one specific conflict or economic shift alone cannot not tell the entire story of any given spike in these graphs.

Relatively simple network effects may offer a broader explanation for why the internal/external connecting ratios of each of these national communities changed in the dramatic way that they did.
In complex systems of all kinds, gradual changes such as generational population growth and decline can frequently manifest as punctuated shifts in the way that complex social networks organize.[A classic discussion of this phenomenon is found in @watts1999, 53.]
Thus, the gradual build-up of printmaking expertise in different regions may _alone_ account for any one of these striking shifts, in which case it would be improper to speculate about a more temporally-bounded cause.
To avoid this hazard, we want to differentiate which EI indices of these communities are _to be expected_ in any community of that size relative to its neighbors, and which are unexpectedly high (favoring international connections) or low (favoring domestic).[^randomcent]

[^randomcent]: On accounting for these properties of the EI index, see [@mariolis1985]; [@hanneman2005, 220--223]. On the use of random network simulation in analysis more generally, see [@zweig2016, ch. 6].

To differentiate the expected from the exceptional, we first create a randomly generated network of the same size and makeup as that which we observe in our real museum data (Figure \@ref(fig:eii-sim-example)a), but absent any international connections.
To decide how to simulate the creation of international connections, we must consider the type of network that printmaking demanded.
The industry required both expertise as well as social connections.
Like many social networks, it favored the already-successful, and the already-well-connected.
Aspiring printmakers from areas with smaller, less developed printmaking communities, on the other hand, would have had little choice but to reach out to foreign centers with more established printmaking infrastructure.
Thus, a set of "international" edges are drawn by choosing source nodes at random, and allowing them to connect to targets chosen based on a randomized distribution that favors already-well-connected nodes.[^random_meth] (Figure \@ref(fig:eii-sim-example)b)
We can then measure the EI indices of each of these simulated regions, and contrast those to the EI indices actually observed from those networks produced from the source museum data.
Where the two measures converge, then we can say that the EI indices are no different than those of any other network with the same relative sizes of communities.
Where they diverge, though, highlights exceptional periods where the model "breaks" because it cannot account for real historical events that may have disrupted the usual functioning of these networks.

[^random_meth]: In the context of making connections within a network, a uniform distribution of ties means that all nodes in the network will have an equal chance of making or receiving a connection.
On the other hand, a _power-law probability distribution_ describes the distribution of some set of ranked occurrences in which small occurrences (e.g. people with only a few social links) are extremely common, whereas large instances (e.g. people with a huge number of social links) are extremely rare.

    The model implemented here sets the connection chance, or fitness $f$, of node $n_i$ such that: $f_{n_i} = i^{-{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}}$
    The exponent $\gamma$ determines the skew of the probability distribution. 
    In this context, the skew governs precisely how attractive well-connected individuals are to new entrants to the network, with a larger skew denoting a stronger attraction.
    A $\gamma$ of $2.25$ provides a close fit for almost every network shown here.
    Foundational work in the generation of random networks, and on the types of degree distributions that resemble real-world networks, is seen in @barabasi1999. The programmatic implementation of this method in R is @csardi2006.

Figure \@ref(fig:eii-sim) overlays the EI indices of these simulated networks on the results observed from the BM data, previously shown in figure \@ref(fig:all-nats-eii).
By in large, both trends overlap: the simulated networks return similar results to those found in the empirical results.
In other workds, regional print production capacity does, in fact, explain a great deal of the variation of these communities' balance of international versus domestic connections, including some of the most massive changes seen in \@ref(fig:all-nats-eii).

However, there are several notable mismatches between the EI indices returned by these randomly generated networks, and those found in the BM and RKM data.
These are points at which this network simulation fails to predict the balance of domestic and international.
Model "failure" in this case need not be an analytical roadblock.
It can productively be rephrased as such: when are the relative sizes of each of these communites alone (the foundation of this model) not enough to explain the balance of network connections?
In those timescapes, what additional effects, such as shorter-term historical events, may have compounded or counteracted the universal network pressures to find well-connected collaborators?

For example, in the northern Netherlands between roughly 1650 and 1675, both the BM- and RKM-based networks return a lower EI index than are predicted by randomized networks of the same relative size.
In other words, Dutch print producers were making a larger number of internal connections during this period than one would expect if _merely_ considering their size relative to other communities.
This disjoint suggests the influence of more short-lived events on the behavior of printmakers during that timespan.
It is possible that the the official end of the revolt in 1648 with the signing of the Treaty of Münster, and a burgeoning sense of national Dutch pride, may have been expressed in prints through more domestically-centered production.[On the growth in privileges issued by the States General at this time, see @hoftijzer1993; @orenstein2006.]
Conversely, in the southern Netherlands, a higher-than-predicted EI index (i.e. more international connections than found in a random network of the same size) around 1580--1610 coincides with the Spanish invasion of Antwerp and the accompanying exodus of Flemish artists, including printmakers.[@sluijter2009, section 3.]
Such a result underlines the enduring effect that Flemish migration had on the art of this period.

One may also point (albeit with slightly less certainty, given the dissimilar results returned by the BM and RKM) to the possible influence of English and French monarchs' artistic priorities on their countries' printmaking communities.
An higher-than-predicted number of international connections in the English printmaking community between 1625 and 1649 coincides with the reign of Charles I, who imported a wide range of both continental artworks and artists to London during his rule.
In France, far more _internal_ connections between French printmakers are found than predicted during the reign of Louis XIV between 1643 and 1715.
Several events during this period may have helped to fortify the already-burgeoning French printmaking community.
In 1655, the _Académie royale de peinture et sculpture_ began to admit printmakers, legitimizing the medium as a fine art rather than a mechanical craft and thus raising the social esteem and professional position of printmakers.[@reed1998, 18--19.]
The Sun King also issued a large number of print privileges during his reign, making the medium a more financially appealing specialty.[@fuhring2002]
Rather than the primary origins of a French printmaking community, these policy changes should be seen as partial (though important) contributors to larger demographic forces already at play.

Both the German and Italian printmaking communities show consistently fewer international connections in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries than are found in simulated communities of equivalent size.^[These trends ought to be treated with more skepticism, given the somewhat different results returned by the BM and RKM.]
Notably, for a period verging on one hundred years, the simulated network predicts more international collaboration by Italian print producers than we actually observe.
What additional events may have caused such a divergence from the model?
While only a supposition, it is possible that the prolonged lack of predicted international collaborations may have been due the plague of 1656 and the economic collapse that followed in its wake.
The Italian peninsula would still be recovering from this disaster a century later, and it appears that the network of artistic print collaboration was not spared.[@alfani2013]

Considered as a whole, it seems little coincidence that the regional networks that were primarily inward-connecting or evenly connecting in the mid-sixteenth century (the southern Netherlands, Italy, and Germany) also had some of the longest-established printmaking traditions, dating back to the late fifteenth century.[@landau1994, ch 1.]
Already possessing well-developed printmaking infrastructure, those regions could host relatively self-sustaining networks of print producers.

Over this period, France and England increased their share of the European urban population, while the population share of Italian and German cities decreased.

The pattern of early printmaking mastery in Italian and German regions, giving way in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to consolidation in the Netherlands, France, and England, mirrors the general trends in European urban populations over this same period. (Figure \@ref(fig:europe-pop))
The share of urban populations living in Italian and German cities decreased between 1500--1800, while the share living in Dutch, French and English cities increased.
The shifts observed in international interaction may have been driven less by particular disruptive historical moments or artistic movements, and more by gradually building structural incentives powered by these changes in populations and the necessarily-collaborative nature of print production.

# The Exceptional Individual

This long-term view of print production is a challenging one for traditional, artist-based perspectives on the history of artistic printmaking.
At the scale of hundreds or thousands of artists working over two centuries, the broad contours of international print production appear to be determined more by demographic changes, rather than the impacts of specific artists, or turning points in political or military history.
And yet, the individual experience of international collaboration and exchange varied widely in this period. (Figure \@ref(fig:ind-eii))
While space here is too limited to explore these examples fully, it is worth illuminating a very brief example of the individual patterns to be found within this macro-history.

Among Flemish print producers, while prominent engravers in the Galle, Wierix, and De Jode families tended to make most of their connections to Flemish collaborators, members of the Sadeler family consistently rank among the more internationally-focused Flemish print producers.[Printmaking dynasties were a distinctive feature of Flemish printmaking organization; such multigenerational print businesses were far less dominant in the northern provinces; @lincoln2016-dah, 149.]
Aegidius Sadeler maintained a roughly even split between collaboration with Flemish and artists and publishers versus foreign ones.[See @limouze1994 for an account of Jan's early work in Mainz and Frankfurt; on Munich, see @limouze2009.]
Meanwhile, standing in contrast to the overall inward-focus of his fellow mid-seventeenth-century Dutch printmakers, such as Jonas Suyderhoef, the exceptionally international Cornelis Bloemaert found great success working in Paris and, later, Rome.[On Bloemaert, see @baldinucci1767, 131--138; @hoogewerff1952, 71, @roethlisberger1993, 513--526; the unexpected centrality of Suyderhoef to this production network is discussed in @lincoln2016-dah, 150.] (Figure \@ref(fig:bloemaert-rivergod).)

```{r bloemaert-rivergod, fig.cap="(ref:bloemaert-rivergod)"}

```

For all the international connections Bloemaert made, however, he relied heavily on fellow expatriates while abroad, albeit in a social capacity, rather than a direct professional one.[Bloemaert's expatriate social network resonates with that of the Dutch etcher and mezzotinter Abraham Blooteling, who established a similar circle while working in London; @curd2010, 127-161.]
This nuance is important to bear in mind when looking at quantitative results that suggest he did most of his work with foreigners.
Bloemaert's case demonstrates the importance of network connections that do not fall within the set of direct ties of artistic source, printmaker, and publisher captured by the datasets used for this study, and suggests promising avenues for future research.

# Conclusion

The art historian instinctively intuits connections between historic events and evidentiary anomalies, be they found in an archive, a collection, or a database.
To build narrative from fragmentary evidence is, to be sure, a core skill in our discipline.
In doing so, however, we often miss the forest for the trees, unknowingly erasing continuities in our disruption-focused narratives.
What appear as dramatic, discontinuous changes in one register of these print production networks (the balance of domestic and international ties) has been shown to be, by in large, the results of gradual, continuous changes in another (the relative populations of each community).
These results provide sorely-needed context for histories of printmaking that privilege national school origin stories and individual printmakers, and provoke further questions about what other _longue durée_ historical factors may have influenced the production and circulation of prints in this period.

This comparative computational approach also underlines the possibility of data-driven research to productively interrogate modern classification systems.
Nethier replicating national categories from these source data unthinkingly, nor discarding them as useless, this dynamic network analysis instead contrasted these assigned communities to the potential communities of production documented on the objects themselves.
When these theoretical and empirical boundaries overlapped, and when they diverged, may differ radically from when those same national categories overlap or diverge from networks of another type, such as familial or religious ones.
Far from reifying unsuitable categories, historical network analysis can better illuminate the plural nature of transnational art histories of the early modern world.
