# Introduction

>There is no better means whereby the painter himself can make his renowned name known: Namely, that he sometimes, using time and diligence for this purpose, engraves one of his celebrated compositions of drawing in print: Because it can go through the whole world, coming into every art lovers' hands, while paintings almost always remain in one place...[^goeree]

[^goeree]: "Daer is oock noch een ander middel, waer door den Schilder hem selven een Vermaerden Naem kan maecken: Namentlijck dat hy somtijts, tijt ende vlijt daer toe aenwent, om eenige van sijn feste ordinantien en teyckeningen in print uyt te geven: Want vermits die de geheele Werelt door-wandelen, en in alle Liefhebbers handen komen, en dat de Schidleryen meest altijt maer in eene plaets blijven... [@goeree1670, 125]"

>...release your works freely into print, so that your name will sooner fly over the world. Albrecht Dürer and Lucas van Leyden, though wondrous painters, obtained their greatest fame from engraving.[^hoog]

[^hoog]: "...laet dan vry uwe werken in print uitkomen, zoo zal uwen naem te spoediger al de werelt over vliegen. _Albert Durer_ en _Lukas van Leyden_, wondere Schilders, hebben nochtans hun grootste gerucht door het graefyzer verkreegen."; [@hoogstraten1678, 195]

>Regarding [prints'] effect: what fame is to the ear, theirs is to the eye. Painting has but one result, but engraving hundreds. Fame can tell the many wonders of painting in its absence; but engraving makes itself present everywhere; it flies the world over, as it sounds the echoing trumpet of renown.[^lairesse]

[^lairesse]: "Wat haare uitwerking aangaat, zy is voor het gezicht het geen de Faam voor het gehoor is. De Schilderkonst heeft maar een Origineel, maar de Graveerkunde honderden. De Faam kan van de Schilderkonst veele wonderen vertellen in haar afweezen: maar de Graveerkunde maakt zich overal tegenwoordig. Zy vliegt zo wel de geheele waereld over, als de klank der galmende trompet des Geruchts."; [@lairesse1712, 2:372--373]

Late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Dutch art commentators Willem Goeree, Samuel van Hoogstraten, and Gérard de Lairesse uniformly agreed on the power of prints to transmit an artist's images far and wide.
Thanks to the relative ease of moving finished impressions, prints had been a mainstay of the international art market in Europe for more than a century and a half.
At the renowned Frankfurt book fair, prominent book publishers even included special sections in their inventory lists devoted to artistic prints and engraved maps.[@paisey2006, 54--55.]
The _consumption_ of prints was clearly internationalized by the early 1500s.
To what extent, however, was their _production_ internationalized?

Starting from the focal point of the northern Netherlands, an early modern printmaking center with both longstanding international influence, as well as a strong domestic print production capacity, this paper will offer a novel perspective on the interconnection of printmaking communities within the larger European world of artistic prints.
Using macro-scale network analysis to characterize the potential historical professional networks that we can infer from two catalogs of surviving print impressions, several questions will be addressed:

1. How did shifts in the northern and southern Netherlands compare to those in other prominent printmaking centers in Italy, Germany, or France? 
2. How varied were individuals' strategies when it came to domestic and international production? 
3. More crucially, were these changes in this production balance determined by specific historical events, or, rather, subject to larger structural incentives coupled to _longue durée_ population shifts across Europe over this period?

While there are, indeed, some dramatic, and dramatically fast, shifts to and from international vs. domestic print production concentration,shared patterns of domestic and international production shifts across other countries in this period suggest that most of these seemingly-dramatic changes can be explained by gradual demographic trends and the relative maturity of different regional print production communities.
That said, key exceptions indicate the occasional power of disruptive events, and even single individuals, to affect a much larger world of printmaking.

# Background: Dutch Internationalism / Dutch Regionalism

The early history of Dutch printmaking is tightly interwoven with international influences.
Lucas van Leyden attracted international acclaim for his masterful handling of the burin.
Among his admirers was no less than the Nuremberg master Albrecht Dürer, who made a point to visit the Leiden artist during a journey to the Netherlands in 1520, where he would exchange 8 florins' worth of his own prints for a complete set of Lucas' own oeuvre when the two met in Leiden.[@marlier1971, 29]
The influence of Lucas' prints extended south of the Alps, too.
In Italy, Marcantonio Raimondi frequently adopted Lucas' silvery background designs for use in his own prints, such as the _Climbers_ of 1510 that melds a landscape quoted from Lucas with figures derived from Michelangelo's renowned drawing of the _Battle of Cascina_.^[On Marcantonio's quotation of Lucas, see @barnes2010, 16.] (Figure \@ref(fig:lucas-raimondi))

Beyond these individual artistic connections, collaborative print production began to take on international dimensions with the rise of large print production houses and the professionalization of engraving in the mid-sixteenth century.
Some Dutch printmakers had built thriving careers creating engravings for Italian painters in Venice and Rome, enjoying the fruits of northern Europeans' reputation for printmaking skill that had been promulgated by Giorgio Vasari.[@landau1983; @gregory2012, 2--4.]
Cornelis Cort, in Rome from 1565--1578, found great success as a printmaker for major Italian painters such as Titian, Giulio Clovio, Girolamo Muziano, and Federico Zuccaro.[@sellink1994; @sman2005, 251--252]
In addition to German and Italian centers, the mid-sixteenth-century publishing house of Hieronymus Cock, _Aux Quatre Vents_, proved especially influential to multiple generations of Dutch printmakers.[For example, during his early career in Haarlem between 1557--1570, Philips Galle engraved several prints to be published in Antwerp by Cock; @sellink1997]

Galle's experience would be mirrored in the following generation of Dutch printmakers.
Early in his career, Hendrick Goltzius produced many reproductive prints for Galle after a wide range of artists.
Goltzius lived in Haarlem while Galle remained based in Antwerp, working via correspondence much as Galle had done for Cock in his early years.
Goltzius would continue this model of remote collaboration even after setting up his own independent studio in 1582.
The collaboration between Hendrick Goltzius and Bartholomeus Spranger, court painter to Rudolf II, illustrates well how the design, cutting, and marketing of a print could easily take on an international scope.[@leeflang2003, 82--83, cat. 28] (Figure \@ref(fig:goltzius-wedding))

```

In the first decades of the seventeenth century, Haarlem printmakers Claesz Jansz Visscher, Esaias van de Velde I, Willem Buytewech, Hercules Segers, and Jan van de Velde II, began to produce their own versions of the local, rustic landscape view first popularized by Hieronymus Cock in Antwerp.[On the relationship of the anonymously-designed _Small Landscapes_ to the printed landscape tradition in Haarlem, see @onuf2011; @onuf2014]
These images, which highlighted specific local landmarks as well as more generalized "Dutch" views, featured distinctive elements such as rolling dunes, canals, and signs of local industry such as linen bleaching.
This local turn in printmaking has been connected with the coalescing of a Dutch national identity during the course of the revolt against Spain between 1568--1648.[@freedberg1980, 11--15; @levesque1994, ch. 6.]
All of these printmakers joined the Haarlem guild in 1612, forming a critical mass of pioneering talent who each took up the printed landscape as their subject in one form or another.


This international flow of images and influence did not occur in a vacuum.

In the late sixteenth century, the northern Netherlands entered a golden age of economic growth thanks to their unmatched control of international sea trade around the world.
As their prosperity increased, many Dutch authors, musicians, and artists sought to add internationalizing elements to their works, as a way of asserting Dutch cultural legitimacy in the broader world of early modern Europe.[On the interest in legitimizing Dutch culture on the European stage, see @kettering1983]
Several waves of Dutch artists also traveled south to study and paint in Italy, establishing an expatriate community in Rome.[On seventeenth-century Dutch artists' interest in Italy, see @schatborn2001; @harwood2002]
Prominent Dutch and Flemish portraitists found many patrons in the English court, and printmakers from the Low Countries were in particular demand in London.
Likewise, foreign publishers and print sellers may have found the thriving Northern Netherlands a particularly attractive market.[@hoftijzer2001, 251--252.]

The political environment may not have been as conducive to the flow of prints across international borders, however.
The start of the Dutch revolt against Spain in 1568 may have made it more difficult for artists in the Low Countries to conduct international business, from the early transmission of contracts and drawn designs to the large shipments of finished impressions required for a successful printmaking business.
At the same time, the flourishing economy supported a blossoming print industry in Amsterdam in particular.[@hoftijzer2001, 249.]
With avenues to international collaboration cut off, and an increasing amount of domestic supply _and_ demand in centers like Haarlem and Amsterdam, Dutch printmakers and publishers may have been encouraged to make more domestic connections than ever before.
Now, rather than having to turn to international partners to produce prints, Dutch artists, printmakers, and publishers could increasingly work with their own countrymen.
A flourishing Dutch art market, both in Amsterdam as well as in smaller towns like Utrecht and Delft, appears to have supported a more decentralized print production network than had existed in the late sixteenth century.[@lincoln2016-2]
It is possible that this same decentralization may have spurred more domestic collaboration as well.

To help lcarify how these competing incentives may have played out over the course of the long seventeenth century, we can turn to network analysis to provide a novel perspective.

# Methodology: Measuring International Interaction

Computational network analysis is a particular discipline for describing networks in a formal way.
While the concept of "network" may seem familiar to many art historians - whether networks of stylistic influence, of artist families and studioes, or of patronage and collecting - computational network analysis demands that preicsly what makes up the members of a network, and the rules used to derive connections between those members, be defined very specifically.
The benefit to adopting these strictures, however, is that it permits us to see the complex topological characterists of a network - how centralized or decentralized it is, the degree of interconnection between its constitutent groups, and which members act as key brokers of connections between disparate communities - that are invisible from the ground-level perspective seen when considering just one relationship at a time.

Such a picture is inevitably flattening; it necessitates discarding a great deal of information.
For example, the production network discussed here is precisely that, a _production-focused_ network, rather than one that incorporates information about familial relationships, or financial relatinoships, or social relationships such as co-membership in a given parish or guild.
But, like an X-radiograph of a painting, with the loss of some information comes the gain of information othewise unseen.
Careful focus on the patterns of print co-production will, in fact, offer us a much broader structural context misisng from other information-rich but scale-poor studies.
Together, both perspectives are more valuable than either one seen alone.

## Data

The data for this study have been drawn from the collections of the British Museum in London (hereafter BM) and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam (hereafter RKM). (Table \@ref(tab:nationality-counts))
Both of these collections feature broad and deep collections of European prints (and Dutch and Flemish prints in particular) from this period.
Moreover, each museum has released meticulous curatorial data aobut these collections amenable to computational processing.

(ref:nationality-counts) Counts of artists (and prints) by nationality in the BM and RKM datasets.

```{r nationality-counts, fig.margin = TRUE}
bm_nats <- c("Dutch", "Flemish", "English", "French", "German", "Italian")

rkm_nats <- c("Noord-Nederlands", "Zuid-Nederlands", "Engels", "Frans", "Duits", "Italiaans")

names(bm_nats) <- rkm_nats

bm_print_count <- bm_print_nodes %>% 
  inner_join(bm_node_nationalities, by = "id") %>% 
  filter(nationality %in% bm_nats) %>% 
  inner_join(bm_print_edges, by = c("id" = "source")) %>% 
  group_by(nationality) %>% 
  summarize(
    bm_n_artists = n_distinct(id), 
    bm_n_prints = n_distinct(object))

rkm_print_count <- rkm_artist_attributes %>% 
  filter(nationality %in% rkm_nats) %>% 
  mutate(nationality = plyr::revalue(nationality, bm_nats)) %>% 
  inner_join(rkm_print_edges, by = c("name" = "source")) %>% 
  group_by(nationality) %>% 
  summarize(
    rkm_n_artists = n_distinct(name),
    rkm_n_prints = n_distinct(object_id))

bm_print_count %>% 
  inner_join(rkm_print_count, by = "nationality") %>% 
  mutate(
    BM = paste0(bm_n_artists, " (", format(bm_n_prints, big.mark = ",", trim = TRUE), ")"),
    RKM = paste0(rkm_n_artists, " (", format(rkm_n_prints, big.mark = ",", trim = TRUE), ")")) %>% 
  select(nationality, `BM artists (prints)` = BM, `RKM artists (prints)` = RKM) %>% 
  kable(caption = "(ref:nationality-counts)")
  
```

Each print in the collection is treated as evidence of a professional relationship (whether direct or indirect) at a certain point in time.
For example, the print in Figure \@ref(fig:goltzius-wedding) would be used to create a connection between Hendrick Goltzius and Bartholomeus Spranger during the year of 1587.[For an in-depth discussion of these data and the methodology for inferring production networks from object-based collections, see @lincoln2016-2, 138-141.]
Rather than producing a single network encompassing every constitutent and connection from 200 years of print production, we can instead takeunderstand how this network change over time by constructing snapshots, or slices, of the entwork as it may have appeared in a given period of time based on the surviving evidence that we have.

When, and to what extent, do actors who belong to one category make connections to each other, versus to actors in another?
This is a common question in network analysis, and can be measured by using the group-external/group-internal index (hereafter EI index).[See, for example, @matos2014, 15]
The EI index measures the balance between the number connections actors made within a specified group (in this case, nationality) versus those they made to actors outside that group.[^krackhardt] (Figure \@ref(fig:eii-example))
This index can work at several scales.
It can be used to quantify an entire group's propensity to connect with other groups (e.g. Dutch artists connecting to non-Dutch artists).
A positive EI index indicates that nodes within that group made most of their connections to nodes belonging to other groups, while a negative EI index indicates those nodes made most of their connections internally.
One can also measure the EI index of a single individual, comparing the number of connections they make to members of their own group, versus to those belonging to another.

[^krackhardt]: The EI index comprises the ratio of the difference between the number of a group's external ($n_e$) and internal ($n_i$) links to the total number of links the group makes:
$$\epsilon = \frac{n_e - n_i}{n_e + n_i}$$

    Originally proposed in [@krackhardt1988, 127--129]; also see [@hanneman2005, 128--132].

Demarcating the "borders" of nationality in the early modern period is an inherently tricky problem, perhaps no more so than in the case of the Low Countries during the age of the Eighty Years War.[On the challenge of constructing the right national context for Netherlandish printmakers in particular, see @kok2015, 348.]
The Dutch 1581 Act of Abjuration (in the wake of the Union of Utrecht two years prior) marks the official schism between the seventeen United Provinces in the northern Netherlands and the territories of the Spanish-controlled southern Netherlands.
And while this break is a convenient historical landmark, it was soon followed by large waves of emigration from the south as Protestants and other non-Catholics fled religious persecution in Antwerp for the relatively more tolerant north.
Many of these migrants were painters like Gillis van Coninxloo, Clara Peeters, and Roelandt Savery, who had an abiding impact on artistic development in the United Provinces.

(ref:eii-example) A network with three groups of 20 nodes each. Group A is densely interconnected, so while its members do make some external connections, by in large they connect to each other. Therefore, that group has a negative EI index. Nodes in group B, on the other hand, make a slim majority of their connections _externally_, giving that group a positive index. Nodes in group C connect exclusively to each other, and so that group has the lowest possible EI index of -1.

```{r eii-example, fig.cap="(ref:eii-example)"}
a <- sample_gnm(20, 50)
V(a)$class <- "A"

```

Flemish printmakers also emigrated to the north, including Nicolaes de Bruyn and Jan van Londerseel, both of whom moved to Rotterdam (Londerseel by 1610, and De Bruyn by 1617).[@vandercoelen1996, 24]
As noted earlier, Flemish landscapes were a crucial inspiration for the popular idiom of local Dutch countryside print series that were popularized by Haarlem printmakers in the 1610s.[On this influence, see @sluijter2009; @porras2013; @onuf2014.]
To split artists from these two countries can be an arbitrary division.[It is also worth noting that, for many foreign patrons, "Dutch" or "Flemish" was a distinction without a difference.
See, for example, Italian disagreement over whether Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst should be referred to as Flemish ("Gerardo Fiammingo") or Dutch ("Gerardo Olandese"): @lincoln2016.]

On the other hand, the distinction was important indeed for Dutch guild leaders who feared that the sudden influx of well-trained artisans from Antwerp at the turn of the century would flood the Dutch market.
As a result, they planned regulations to protect native Dutch artists from this new competition.[@sluijter2009]
The division has also remained undeniably useful for art historians, and is reflected in the datasets used for this analysis.
Both the BM and the RKM database differentiate between "Dutch"/"Noord-Nederlands" and "Flemish"/"Zuid-Nederlands" artists.[^bmdf]
For the purposes of this analysis, I will accept the present database classifications.[^belgian]
While this is an imperfect compromise, a benefit to this computational framework is that future, alternative classification schemes for artist nationality may be quickly substituted in this analysis, and their ramifications compared to the results presented here.

[^bmdf]: While the RKM assigns only one nationality per artist, the BM allows artists to take multiple nationalities, though only six printmaking artists have been tagged as both "Dutch" and "Flemish": Nicolas de Bruyn, Daniel van den Bremden, Egbert van Panderen, Gijsbert van Veen, and Hans Bol.

[^belgian]: Both the RKM and BM begin to classify artists born in the Austrian Netherlands (post-1715) as "Belgian/Begisch", however there are only a small handful of such artists whose work falls into the 1550--1750 period examined here.
For the purposes of this analysis, these few artists will be treated as Flemish.

# Results: Catalysts and Sudden Shifts

(ref:all-nats-eii) The EI Index for Dutch, Flemish, French, British, German, and Italian printmaking communities between 1550--1750. At 1, all connections made by an actor are to actors outside their national group. At 0, they have an equal number of internal and external connections. At -1, all their connections are to actors within their national group.

Figure \@ref(fig:all-nats-eii) plots the changing EI index for Dutch, Flemish, French, British, German, and Italian printmaking communities between 1550--1750, comparing the trends observed from both the BM and RKM datasets.
Both museum databases return roughly equivalent results for both the Dutch and Flemish printmaking communities.
Expanding our scope to look at other major European regions, the BM and RKM datasets also roughly agree on the EI index for French, German, and Italian print production.
The only major discrepancy between the two datasets is for the EI index of the English printmaking community.
Given the vast superiority of the BM's holdings in English prints (Table \ref@(tab:nationality-counts)), the trend observed from the BM data is likely more representative than that observed from the RKM.

Dutch artists primarily connected to foreign collaborators up until the 1570s, when they shifted quickly to a roughly even split between domestic versus foreign connections.
After this sudden shift, Dutch artists and printmakers continued to favor mostly domestic collaborators, hovering around an EI index of -0.5, i.e. making at least 75% of their connections to fellow Dutchmen.
The Flemish printmaking community presents a rough inverse of this pattern, making most of its connections internally in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, before quickly shifting around 1675 to majority-external connections.

These results support the hypothesis that Dutch printmaking experienced a domestic "turn" not only in subject and style, but also in the infrastructure of print production itself.
Dutch artists rapidly shifted in the late sixteenth century to having their designs reproduced by fellow Dutch printmakers and publishers, rather than by foreign engravers.
Even more dramatically, Dutch printmakers who had worked almost exclusively with foreign publishers like Hieronymus Cock increasingly began to work more with Dutch publishers, many of whom had trained as engravers themselves before opening their own shops.
It is somewhat surprising to note that this turn occurred in the 1570s, well before the commonly-acknowledged burst of particularly "domestic" subjects in Haarlem in the 1610s.
Even more surprising is how swiftly this landscape of print production changed.
Within just a few years, Dutch artists moved from making over three-quarters of their connections to foreign sources, to a roughly even split.
We see a similarly precipitate turn in the Southern Netherlands in the mid-seventeenth century --- but towards more international production, rather than more domestic.

It is possible that Flemish print producers began looking for work and collaborators outside their borders, much as many other luxury exporters did in response to the general stagnation of the Flemish economy in the mid-seventeenth century.[Flemish artists and book publishers dramatically increased the amount of paintings, books, and tapestries they exported via the Northern Netherlands in the wake of the Treaty of Münster; @rasterhoff2014, 136--140; also see @blonde2002, 25--27]
However, it is all too easy overdetermine explanations for changes in these types of social networks based on particular events.
Indeed, we can observe rapid shifts from majority-external to majority-internal printmaking collaboration in the French and English communities that are quite similar to the pattern seen in the northern Netherlands.
Both the French and English communities also begin this period making most of their connections externally, but each underwent their own separate, inward shifts at 1620 and 1650, respectively.
The German and Italian print production networks, on the other hand, began this period internally-connected, only to trend gradually towards more external connections.
Neither the German nor the Italian printmaking communities made changes as drastic as their European counterparts.

What was the source of these challenges?

# Disruption / Continutiy: Modelling the Print Production Network

It seems little coincidence that the regional networks that were primarily inward-connecting or evenly connecting in the mid-sixteenth century (the southern Netherlands, Italy, and Germany) also had some of the longest-established printmaking traditions, dating back to the late fifteenth century.[@landau1994, ch 1.]
Building up a viable regional production network took time and resources.
Over time, these externally-dependent regions would begin to cultivate more native talent, knowledge, and physical resources, as experienced printmakers trained new students and transitioned from making prints to establishing their own publishing firms.
As domestic capacity grew, so too would the incentive for artists and printmakers to partner with domestic collaborators.
Already possessing well-developed printmaking infrastructure, those regions could host relatively self-sustaining networks of print producers.
Aspiring printmakers from areas with smaller, less developed printmaking communities, on the other hand, would have had little choice but to reach out to foreign centers with more established printmaking infrastructure.

Under this theory, we'd expect to see a shared pattern of "inward turns" at different points in time for  northern Netherlands, France, and England.
Notably, the shifts were most abrupt in communities that were concentrated in particularly small geographic areas (the Northern and Southern Netherlands, England), with more gradual changes in the communities spread across a larger area (Italian, French, and German).

(ref:europe-pop) Proportional populations of different European regions. Over this period, France and England increased their share of the European urban population, while the population share of Italian and German cities decreased. The Dutch share of the European urban population peaked in 1650. (\"Other\" regions include Scandinavia, Scotland and Ireland, and eastern Europe).

The pattern of early printmaking mastery in Italian and German regions, giving way in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to concentration in the Netherlands, France, and England, mirrors the general trends in European urban populations over this same period. (Figure \@ref(fig:europe-pop))[These population data have been derived from @devries1984, appendix 1; a digitized version of this dataset is published in @lincoln_europop]
The share of urban populations living in Italian and German cities decreased between 1500--1800, while the share living in French and English cities increased.
Dutch urban populations peaked in 1650, the same time that the Dutch printmaking network had the lowest EI index, i.e. the greatest preference for _internal_ connections.
These observed shifts in international interaction may have been driven less by particular disruptive historical moments or artistic movements, and more by gradually building structural incentives powered by changes in populations and the necessarily-collaborative nature of print production.

The onset of the Dutch revolt, the blockade of the Scheldt, the end of the English civil war: each of these events may have tipped the balance of incentives and sparked a sudden shift in print producers' organization.
However, if these events were _necessary_ to cause these organizational changes, they were not _sufficient_.
Although specific historical events may certainly have affected the ways that printmakers and publishers from different countries worked together, political changes or military conflicts were short-term happenings that occurred within a landscape of long-term incentives and population trends.
In other words, the effects of one specific conflict or economic shift alone does not tell the entire story.
Relatively simple network effects resulting from the gradual buildup of printmaking expertise in different regions can offer a broader explanation for why the internal/external connecting ratios of each of these national communities changed in the dramatic way that they did, transforming gradual changes in population into puncutated shifts in the way that print production communities organized.

[^randomcent]: On accounting for these properties of the EI index, see [@mariolis1985]; [@hanneman2005, 220--223].

We want to differentiate which EI indices of these communities are _to be expected_ in any community of that size relative to its neighbors, and which are unexpectedly high (favoring international connections) or low (favoring domestic).[^randomcent]
To differentiate the expected from the exceptional, we will literally create a randomly generated network of the same size and makeup as that which we observe in our real museum data, measure the EI indices of its groups, and contrast those to the eII values we actually observed in hte museumdata.
Wjere the two converge, we can say that such behavior may be "expected"---where they diverge, this highlights excpetional periods where the model "breaks" because it accounts only for population size and connetivity, and not for any real historical events that may have disrupted the general continuity of these print production networks.

1. For each year, generate a series of unconnected networks, each with the same number of nodes and edges as found in each of the regional printmaking communities in the BM and RKM data.
This will result in several national clusters without any bridging links. (Figure \@ref(fig:eii-sim-example) (a))
2. Add a second set of "international" edges by choosing several source nodes at random, and several target nodes based on a power law probability distribution.[^random_meth] (Figure \@ref(fig:eii-sim-example) (b))
3. Measure the EI index of each of these resulting communities, and compare with the results from the BM and RKM data.

Figure \@ref(fig:eii-sim) overlays the EI indices of these simulated networks on the results observed from the BM and RKM data.
By in large, the simulated networks return similar results to those found in the empirical results.
This underlines the major governing factor that regional print production capacity --- in other words, the size of the network --- had on any one community's balance of international versus domestic connections.
However, there are several notable mismatches between the EI indices returned by these randomly generated networks, and those found in the BM and RKM data.

For example, in the northern Netherlands between roughly 1650 and 1675, both the BM- and RKM-based networks return a lower EI index than are predicted by randomized networks of the same relative size.
In other words, Dutch print producers were making an unexpectedly large number of internal connections during this period, given their size relative to other communities.
Could this be a consequence of the official end of the revolt in 1648 with the signing of the Treaty of Münster?
It is possible that the close of the war, and a burgeoning sense of national Dutch pride, may have been expressed in prints through more domestically-centered production.[On the growth in privileges issued by the States General at this time, see @hoftijzer1993; @orenstein2006.]
Conversely, in the southern Netherlands, a higher-than-expected EI index (i.e. more international connections than found in a random network of the same size) around 1580--1610 coincides with the Spanish invasion of Antwerp and the accompanying exodus of Flemish artists, including printmakers.[@sluijter2009]

One may also point (albeit with slightly less certainty, given the dissimilar results returned by the BM and RKM) to the possible influence of English and French monarchs' artistic priorities on their countries' printmaking communities.
An unexpectedly high number of international connections in the English printmaking community between 1625 and 1649 coincides with the reign of Charles I, who imported a wide range of both continental artworks and artists to London during his rule.
In France, far more _internal_ connections between French printmakers are found than expected are found during the reign of Louis XIV between 1643 and 1715.
In 1655, the _Académie royale de peinture et sculpture_ began to admit printmakers, legitimizing the medium as a fine art rather than a mechanical craft.[@reed1998, 18--19.]
Moreover, the Sun King issued a large number of print privileges during his reign, and may have gone a long way towards promoting French artistic talent.[@fuhring2002]

Both the German and Italian printmaking communities show consistently fewer international connections in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries than are found in simulated communities of equivalent size.
(Again, these trends ought to be treated with more skepticism, given the somewhat different results returned by the BM and RKM.)
The privations of the Thirty Years' War, which persisted in the German region long after the nominal end of the conflict in 1648, may have inhibited the German print production industry from establishing as many international contacts as a market of their size would have suggested.[@rabb1962]
As for Italian printmakers, their unexpectedly low number of external connections may have been due, in part, to the plague of 1656 and the economic collapse that followed in its wake.
The Italian peninsula would still be recovering from this disaster a century later.[@alfani2013]

# Case Studies of Traveling Printmakers

This long-term view of print production is a challenging one for traditional, artist-based perspectives on the history of artistic printmaking.
At the scale of hundreds or thousands of artists working over two centuries, the broad contours of international print production appear to be determined more by demographic changes, rather than the impacts of specific artists, or turning points in political or military history.
And yet, the individual experience of international collaboration and exchange varied widely in this period.
Several case studies of artists hailing from both the southern and northern Netherlands will illustrate just how diverse these interactions could be.

Family dynasties played a key role in the Flemish print production network.[@lincoln2016-2, 149-152]
This broader European perspective reveals important distinctions between the comparative international reach of these families.
While prominent engravers in the Galle, Wierix, and De Jode families tended to make most of their connections to Flemish collaborators, members of the Sadeler family consistently rank among the more internationally-focused Flemish print producers, with Jan (Johann) I Sadeler and Aegidius II Sadeler maintaining a roughly even split between collaboration with Flemish and artists and publishers versus foreign ones. (Figure \@ref(fig:rkm-flem-ind-eii))

The Sadelers leveraged their early displacement from Antwerp in 1586 into a highly successful dynasty connected not only to their original home in Flanders, but also to the Hapsburg court in Prague and to Italian circles in both Venice and Rome.
In 1586, Jan I and his brother and fellow engraver, Raphael I, along with their nephew Aegidius I, fled political turmoil in Antwerp for Mainz, followed by Frankfurt and then to the court of Duke Wilhelm V in Munich.[See @limouze1994 for an account of Jan's early work in Mainz and Frankfurt; on Munich, see @limouze2009.]
The Sadelers continued to engrave and publish prints in each of these cities, as evidenced by the constantly changing addresses inscribed on each print.[All of their impressions from this period list a Sadeler (usually Raphael) as _executor_; @limouze2009, 117--118.]
Aegidius found his greatest success in Prague as a court engraver for the Hapsburg emperors Rudolf II, Matthias, and Ferdinand II.[@limouze1989, 10]
Though he does not rank among the most central Flemish print producers of the seventeenth century, Jan Sadeler's son Justus also played a significant role in building the family's ties to Italy.[On Justus, see @senechal1990.]
Justus inherited most of his father's plates, and would continue to publish impressions of these older designs while working in Italy.
These bonds of family, combined with their shared talents with the burin, allowed the Sadelers to patch together a remarkably successful printmaking dynasty in spite of their itinerant lives.

In the north, traveling printmakers were also an exception to the overall preference by Dutch print producers for domestic collaborators in the seventeenth century.
Figure \@ref(fig:rkm-dutch-ind-eii) shows a sample of the most central participants in the Dutch printmaking network across several different periods.[^infl]
While the _overall_ Dutch EI index was negative in the mid-seventeenth century, it is easy to find examples of Dutch artists who did a great deal of international work, just as it is common to find ones who worked almost exclusively with other Dutch artists and publishers.

[^infl]: Influence is ranked by degree centrality, the metric used in chapter 2, figures \@ref(fig:bm-dutch-ind-cent) and \@ref(fig:bm-flem-ind-cent.)

One exceptin was Cornelis Bloemaert the Younger, who was born in Utrecht around 1603.[@roethlisberger1993, 513--526.]
He initially studied painting with his father, Abraham Bloemaert, but would later train as an engraver with Crispijn de Passe.[@baldinucci1767, 131--138]
He left his hometown for Paris in 1630, where he would work for three years engraving designs after various French masters.
By 1634, he had arrived in Rome, where he joined the "Bentvueghels", an expatriate fraternity of northern European artists working in Rome.
He was one of a handful of engravers who would come to join the group, including the Flemish engraver Michel Natalis, and Reiner Persijn from Alkmaar, who studied with Bloemaert while in Rome.[@hoogewerff1952, 71]
While in Rome, he made a living producing engravings mostly after Italian works.
Bloemaert contracted with the Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani to produce a series of plates depicting the Marchese's collection of antique statuary (Figure \@ref(fig:bloemaert-rivergod).)
Though this project was cut short by the Marchese's death, Bloemaert would continue to produce engravings primarily after the art collections of major patrons, producing prints after diverse Italian masters such as Pietro da Cortona, Andrea Sacchi, Guido Reni, and Raphael.
He would work in Rome until his death in 1692.

(ref:bloemaert-rivergod) Cornelis Bloemaert II after a drawing by Giovanni Citosibio Guidi, *River God* from *Galleria Giustiniana del Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani* (Rome, 1636). Engraving, 23.1 x 21.5 cm. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.

```{r bloemaert-rivergod, out.width = "3.5in", fig.cap="(ref:bloemaert-rivergod)"}
include_graphics("assets/images/bloemaert_rivergod.jpg")
```

Bloemaert's unsurpassed commercial success in foreign territory can be ascribed to his professional networking prowess.
Lacking the established professional network he could have accessed through his father had he remained in Utrecht, Bloemaert cultivated his own transnational network at each step in his career.
Notably, many impressions of the Italian prints that Bloemaert engraved bear the address of Pierre Mariette I, a Parisian publisher Bloemaert had published with during his time there between 1630 and 1633.[Mariette probably traveled to Rome in 1634 around the same time that Bloemaert arrived in the city; @weigert1953, 171.]
Bloemaert would also build on his success making engravings for elite Roman collectors, contracting with the Barberini as well as with Cardinal Giulio Cesare Sacchetti.
Surviving documents of Bloemaert's interaction with the cardinal reveal how detailed the breakdown of engraving expenses could be.
A surviving letter from the painter Pietro da Cortona to Cardinal Sacchetti's steward enumerates separate line items owed to Bloemaert for the figural illustration of a particular engraving, listing a charge for the decorative border, another for the inscription, one for the coat of arms, as well as a line for the copper plates themselves.[@kraemer1989, 414]
Bloemaert's prints were valued enough to be displayed not only in albums, but also on walls: a series of illustrations Bloemaert engraved for Sacchetti's thesis would later be set in an elaborate frame in the Palazzo Sacchetti.[@kraemer1989, 415]

## Abraham Blooteling

Another of the handful of influential Dutch engravers who made most of his connections to foreign collaborators in the late seventeenth century was Abraham Blooteling, who would come to be known for his skill in the novel mezzotint technique.[For Blooteling's oeuvre, see @wessely1867.]
Blooteling was born in Amsterdam, where he trained with Cornelis van Daelen I.
Like Bloemaert, Blooteling's first international destination was Paris; he arrived there in 1660.
He apprenticed with Pierre van Schuppen, member of a small group of Flemish engravers working in the city.
Blooteling met another mezzotint innovator in Paris named Wallerant Vaillant.
Blooteling and Vaillant would both return to Amsterdam in 1665, where they continued to work together closely, sharing _modelli_ and print designs that Blooteling had inherited from Van Daelen.[@curd2010, 129--133]

Blooteling made his biggest impact, however, in London.
Dutch printmaking talent and Dutch prints had been in high demand in England since the sixteenth century, when Crispijn de Passe sold impressions to the London market while working in Cologne.[@sluijter2003, 15.]
In the wake of the Restoration, Dutch painters and printmakers alike flocked to London as they followed Charles II (and the patronage of his court) when he returned from his exile in The Hague.
Blooteling moved several years later, leaving Amsterdam in 1673 at the invitation of King Charles' cousin, Prince Rupert of the Rhine.
The invitation may have been all the more attractive to Blooteling following the 1672 French invasion of the Netherlands, which had caused an economic contraction that likely depressed the Dutch art market.
Blooteling was strategic in his planning, however.
Mary Bryan Curd has convincingly demonstrated how Blooteling mobilized his network of students and patrons in order to establish himself in London.
He ensured that his apprentice, Jan van Munnickhuijsen, would be able to accompany him to London and provide valuable labor and financial support.
Like Bloemaert in Rome, Blooteling also leveraged his print subjects and patrons to attract more business once in the new city.
One of his first publications were engraved portraits of Rupert and Charles: gifts to those who had invited him, but also a signal to potential English clients of his ability to engrave refined likenesses.
Blooteling would continue to differentiate himself by introducing print portrait series (a staple of Dutch artistic printmaking) to London audiences.[@curd2010, 137]
Like Bloemaert, Blooteling derived long-term benefits from local networks he worked to establish while abroad.
Even after returning to Amsterdam in 1678, Blooteling continued to market his prints in England via his London contacts.[@curd2010, 153]
However, he clearly understood the distinct tastes of the Amsterdam market as well, producing more etchings and engravings after Dutch subjects in this final phase of his career.

For all the international connections they made, it is interesting to note that both Bloemaert and Blooteling relied heavily on fellow expatriates when they made their moves to Paris, Rome, and London.
This nuance is an important to bear in mind when looking at quantitative results that suggest both engravers did most of their work with foreigners.
Both of these cases also demonstrate the importance of network connections that do not fall within the set of direct ties of artistic source, printmaker, and publisher captured by the datasets used for this study.
The funding and social connections of family members, patrons, and even portrait subjects were integral to both Bloemaert's and Blooteling's success.

# Conclusion: Continuity and Change

What appears as dramatic, discontinuous change in one register is revealed to be gradual, continuous change in other.

However, like many complex systems, most of the larger structural changes these print production networks underwent, though unpredictable and sudden when viewed in the short term, can be understood as emergent consequences of slow-moving demographic change and the gradual transfer of technical and artistic knowledge between different European communities.

## Probability Distributions

A probability distribution assigned the probability that a variable will have a particular value within a particular range.
Different types of probability distributions weight probabilities differently.
For example, in a _uniform probability distribution_, all possibilities have an equal probability.
In the context of making connections within a network, a uniform distribution of ties means that all nodes in the network will have an equal chance of making or receiving a connection.
On the other hand, a _power-law probability distribution_ describes the distribution of some set of ranked occurrences in which small occurrences (e.g. people with only a few social links) are extremely common, whereas large instances (e.g. people with a huge number of social links) are extremely rare.

The model implemented here sets the connection chance, or fitness $f$, of node $n_i$ such that: $f_{n_i} = i^{-{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}}$
The exponent $\gamma$ determines the skew of the probability distribution.
In this context, the skew governs precisely how attractive well-connected individuals are to new entrants to the network, with a larger skew denoting a stronger attraction.[On this model for generating random networks, see @barabasi1999, 511; and the R implementation in @csardi2006]
A $\gamma$ of $2.25$ provides a close fit for almost every network shown here.
